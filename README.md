# Introduction


## Concurrency vs parallelism

- Concurrency is about dealing with many things at once.
- Parallelism is about doing many things at once.

- Concurrency is a way to structure things so you can maybe use parallelism to do a better job.


## Understanding threads and queues

- Every program launches with at least one thread where its work takes place, called the `main thread`.

- That initial thread – the one the app is first launched with – always exists for the lifetime of the app, and it’s always called the `main thread`.

- This is important, because all your user interface work must take place on that `main thread`.

- If you try to update your UI from any other thread in your program you might find nothing happens, you might find your app crashes, or pretty much anywhere in between.

- Swapping threads is known as a `context switch`, and it has a performance cost: the system must stash away all the data the thread was using and remember how far it had progressed in its work, before giving another thread the chance to run.

- Apart from that `main thread` of work that starts our whole program and manages the user interface, we normally prefer to think of our work in terms of `queues`.

- We create a queue and add work to it, and the system will remove and execute work from there in the order it was added.

- Sometimes the `queues are serial`, which means they remove one piece of work from the front of the queue and complete it before going onto the next piece of work.

- Sometimes they are `concurrent`, which means they remove and execute multiple pieces of work at a time.

- Either way work will start in the order it was added to the queue unless we specifically say something has a high or low priority.

- Sometimes `serial queues` are required to ensure our data is safe, because it stops you from trying to read the data at the same time some other part of your program is trying to write new data.

- `Threads` are the individual slices of a program that do pieces of work.

- `Queues` are like pipelines of execution where we can request that work can be done at some point.


## Main thread and main queue

- `Main thread` is the one that starts our program, and it’s also the one where all our UI work must happen.

-  Your `main queue` will always execute on the `main thread` and is therefore where you’ll be doing your UI work, it’s also possible that `other queues` might sometimes run on the `main thread` – the system is free to move things around in whatever way is most efficient.

- If you’re on the `main queue` then you’re definitely on the `main thread`.

- Being on the `main thread` doesn’t automatically mean you’re on the `main queue`, a different queue could temporarily be running on the `main thread`.


## Where is Swift concurrency supported?

- When it was originally announced, Swift concurrency required at least `iOS 15`, macOS 12, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, or on other platforms at least `Swift 5.5`.

- If you’re building your code using `Xcode 13.2` or later you can back deploy to older versions of each of those operating systems: `iOS 13`, macOS 10.15, watchOS 6, and tvOS 13 are all supported. 

- This offers the full range of Swift functionality, including `actors`, `async/await`, the `task APIs`, and more.

- This backwards compatibility applies only to Swift language features, not to any APIs built using those language features.

- If you are keen to use the newer APIs in your project while also preserving backwards compatibility for older OS releases, your best bet is to `add a runtime version check for iOS 15` then wrap the older APIs with `continuations`.

- This kind of hybrid solution allows you to keep using `async/await` elsewhere in your project – you get all the benefits of concurrency for the vast majority of your code, while keeping your backwards deployment shims neatly organized in one place so they can be removed in a year or two.


# Async/await


## What is a synchronous function?

- By default, all Swift functions are `synchronous`.

- A `synchronous` function is one that executes all its work in a simple, straight line on a single thread.

- `synchronous` functions are very easy to think about: when you call function A, it will carry on working until all its work is done, then return a value.

- If while working, function A calls function B, and perhaps functions C, D, and E as well, it doesn’t matter – `they all will execute on the same thread`, and run one by one until the work completes.

- Internally this is handled as a `function stack`: whenever one function calls another, the system creates what’s called a `stack frame` to store all the data required for that new function – that’s things like its local variables, for example. 

- That new `stack frame` gets pushed on top of the previous one, like a stack of Lego bricks, and if that function calls a third function then another `stack frame` is created and added above the others. 

- Eventually the functions finish, and their `stack frame` is removed and destroyed in a process we call `popping`, and control goes back to whichever function the code was called from.

- `Synchronous` functions have an important downside, which is that they are `blocking`. 

- If function A calls function B and needs to know what its return value is, then function A must wait for function B to finish before it can continue.

- `blocking` code is problematic because now you’ve `blocked a whole thread`.

- Although `synchronous` functions are easy to think about and work with, they aren’t very efficient for certain kinds of tasks. 

- To make our code more flexible and more efficient, it’s possible to create `asynchronous` functions instead.


## What is an asynchronous function?

- Swift functions are `synchronous` by default, we can make them `asynchronous` by adding one keyword: `async`.

- Inside `asynchronous` functions, we can call other `asynchronous functions` using a second keyword: `await`.

- As a result you will hear Swift developers talk about `async/await` as a way of coding.

- `Synchronous` function that rolls a virtual dice and returns its result:

```swift
func randomD6() -> Int {
    Int.random(in: 1...6)
}

let result = randomD6()
print(result)
```

- `Asynchronous` function that rolls a virtual dice and returns its result:

```swift
func randomD6() async -> Int {
    Int.random(in: 1...6)
}

let result = await randomD6()
print(result)
```

- The only part of the code that changed is adding the `async` keyword before the return type and the `await` keyword before calling it.

- Those changes tell us three important things about `async` functions:


1- First, `async` is part of the function’s type. 

- The original, `synchronous function returns an integer`, which means we can’t use it in a place that expects it to return a string, by marking the code `async` we’ve now made it an `asynchronous function that returns an integer`, which means we can’t use it in a place that expects a `synchronous function that returns an integer`.

- The `async` nature of the function is part of its type: it affects the way we refer to the function everywhere else in our code.

- This is exactly how `throws` works – `you can’t use a throwing function in a place that expects a non-throwing function`.


2- Second, notice that the work inside our function hasn’t actually changed. 

- The same work is being done as before: this function doesn’t actually use the `await` keyword at all, and that’s okay. 

- You see, marking a function with `async` means it might do `asynchronous work`, not that it must. 

- Again, the same is true of `throws` – some paths through a function might throw, but others might not.


3- A third key difference arises when we call randomD6(), because we need to do so `asynchronously`. 

- Swift provides a few ways we can do this, but in our example we used `await`, which means `“run this function asynchronously and wait for its result to come back before continuing.”`

- So, what’s the actual difference between `synchronous` and `asynchronous` functions we can demostrate it using a real function that does some `async` work to fetch a file from a web server:

```swift
func fetchNews() async -> Data? {
    do {
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/news-1.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return data
    } catch {
        print("Failed to fetch data")
        return nil
    }
}

if let data = await fetchNews() {
    print("Downloaded \(data.count) bytes")
} else {
    print("Download failed.")
}
```

- `URLSession.shared.data(from:)` method is called `asynchronous` – its job is to fetch some data from a web server, without causing the whole program to freeze up.

- We’ve already seen that `synchronous` functions cause `blocking`, which leads to performance problems. 

- `Async` functions do not block: when we call them with `await` we are marking a `suspension point`, which is a place where the function can suspend itself – literally stop running – so that other work can happen. 

- At some point in the future the function’s work completes, and Swift will wake it back up out of its “suspended animation”-like existence and it will carry on working.

- First, when an `async function is suspended`, all the `async functions that called it are also suspended`; they all wait quietly while the `async work happens`, then resume later on. 

- This is really important: `async functions have this special ability to be suspended` that `regular synchronous functions do not`. 

- It’s for this reason that `synchronous functions` cannot call `async functions` directly – they don’t know how to suspend themselves.

- Second, a function can be suspended as many times as is needed, but it won’t happen without you writing `await` there – functions won’t suspend themselves by surprise.

- Third, a `function that is suspended does not block the thread it’s running on`, and instead `it gives up that thread so that Swift can do other work instead`. 

- Note: Although we can tell Swift how important many tasks are, we don’t get to decide exactly how the system schedules our work – it automatically takes care of all the threads working under the hood. 

- This means if we call `async function A` without waiting for its result, then a moment later call `async function B`, it’s entirely `possible B will start running before A does`.

- Fourth, when the function resumes, it might be running on the same thread as before, but it might not.

- Swift gets to choose, and you shouldn’t make any assumptions here. 

- This means by the time your function resumes all sorts of things might have changed in your program – a few milliseconds might have passed, or perhaps 20 seconds or more.

- And finally just because a function is `async` doesn’t mean it will suspend – the `await keyword` only `marks a potential suspension point`.

- Most of the time Swift knows perfectly well that the function we’re calling is `async`, so this `await` keyword it’s `a way of clearly marking which parts of the function might suspend`, so you can know for sure which parts of the function run as one atomic chunk.

- “Atomic” means “indivisible” – a chunk of work where all lines of code will execute without being interrupted by other code running.

- This requirement for `await` is identical to the requirement for `try`, where we must mark each line of code that might throw errors.

- `Async` functions are like regular functions, except if they need to, they `can suspend themselves and all their callers, freeing up their thread to do other work`.


## How to create and call an async function

- Using `async functions` in Swift is done in two steps: 

1. Declaring the function itself as being `async`. 

2. Calling that function using `await`.

-  If we were building an app that wanted to:

1. Download a whole bunch of temperature readings from a weather station. 

2. Calculate the average temperature.

3. Upload those results

- We might want to make all three of those async:

1. Downloading data from the internet should always be done `asynchronously`, even a very small download can take a long time if the user has a bad cellphone connection.

2. Doing lots of mathematics might run quickly if the system is doing nothing else, but it might also take a long time if you have complex work and the system is busy doing something else.

3. Uploading data to the internet suffers from the same networking problems as downloading, and should always be done `asynchronously`.

- To actually use those functions we would then need to write a fourth function that calls them one by one and prints the response. 

- This function also needs to be `async`, because in theory the three functions it calls could suspend and so it might also need to be suspended.

```swift
func fetchWeatherHistory() async -> [Double] {
    (1...100_000).map { _ in Double.random(in: -10...30) }
}

func calculateAverageTemperature(for records: [Double]) async -> Double {
    let total = records.reduce(0, +)
    let average = total / Double(records.count)
    return average
}

func upload(result: Double) async -> String {
    "OK"
}

func processWeather() async {
    let records = await fetchWeatherHistory()
    let average = await calculateAverageTemperature(for: records)
    let response = await upload(result: average)
    print("Server response: \(response)")
}

await processWeather()
```

- So, we have three simple `async functions` that fit together to form a sequence: `download some data`, `process that data`, `then upload the result`. 

- That all gets stitched together into a cohesive flow using the `processWeather()` function, which can then be called from elsewhere.

- That’s not a lot of code, but it is a lot of functionality:

- Every one of those `await` calls is a `potential suspension point`, which is why we marked it explicitly. Like I said, one `async function` can `suspend as many times as is needed`.

- Swift will run each of the `await` calls `in sequence`, waiting for the previous one to complete. This is not going to run several things in parallel.

- Each time an `await` call finishes, its final value gets assigned to one of our constants – `records`, `average`, and `response`. 

- Once created this is just regular data, no different from if we had created it `synchronously`.

- Because it calls `async functions` using `await`, it is required that `processWeather()` be itself an `async function`. If you remove that Swift will refuse to build your code.

- When reading `async functions` like this one, it’s good practice to look for the `await` calls because they are all places where unknown other amounts of work might take place before the next line of code executes.

```swift
func processWeather() async {
    let records = await fetchWeatherHistory()
    // anything could happen here
    let average = await calculateAverageTemperature(for: records)
    // or here
    let response = await upload(result: average)
    // or here
    print("Server response: \(response)")
}
```

- We’re only using `local variables` inside this function, so they `are safe`. 

- However, if you were relying on `properties from a class`, for example, they `might have changed` between each of those `await` lines.

- Swift provides ways of protecting against this using a system known as `actors`.


## How to call async throwing functions

- Swift’s `async functions` can be `throwing` or `non-throwing` depending on how you want them to behave.

- Although we mark the function as being `async` `throws`, we call the function using `try` `await` the keyword order is flipped.

```swift
func fetchFavorites() async throws -> [Int] {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-favorites.json")!
    let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
    return try JSONDecoder().decode([Int].self, from: data)
}

if let favorites = try? await fetchFavorites() {
    print("Fetched \(favorites.count) favorites.")
} else {
    print("Failed to fetch favorites.")
}
```

- `fetchFavorites()` method attempts to download some JSON from the server, decode it into an array of integers, and return the result.

- Both `fetching data` and `decoding` it are throwing functions, so we need to use `try` in both those places.

- Those errors aren’t being handled in the function, so we need to mark `fetchFavorites()` as also being `throwing` so Swift can let any errors bubble up to whatever called it.

- Notice that the function is marked `async throws` but the function calls are marked `try await` so the keyword order gets reversed.

- So, it’s `“asynchronous, throwing”` in the function definition, but `“throwing, asynchronous”` at the call site. 

- Think of it as `unwinding a stack`.

- Not only does `try await` read more easily, but it’s also more reflective of what’s actually happening when our code executes.

- We’re waiting for some work to complete, and when it does complete we’ll check whether it ended up throwing an error or not.


## What calls the first async function?

- You can only call `async functions` from `other async functions`, because they `might need to suspend` themselves and everything that is waiting for them.

- If only `async functions` can call `other async functions`, what starts it all what calls the very first async function?

- Well, there are three main approaches you’ll find yourself using:

1- First, in simple command-line programs using the `@main attribute`, you can declare your `main()` method to be `async`. 

- This means your program will immediately launch into an `async function`, so you can call `other async functions` freely.

```swift
func processWeather() async {
    // Do async work here
}

@main
struct MainApp {
    static func main() async {
        await processWeather()
    }
}
```

2- Second, in apps built with something like `SwiftUI` the framework itself has various places that can trigger an `async function`. 

- For example, the `refreshable()` and `task()` modifiers can both call `async functions` freely.

- Using the `task()` modifier we could write a simple “View Source” app that fetches the content of a website when our view appears:

- Tip: Using `task()` will almost certainly `run our code away from the main thread`, but the `@State property wrapper` has specifically been `written to allow us to modify its value on any thread`.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var sourceCode = ""

    var body: some View {
        ScrollView {
            Text(sourceCode)
        }
        .task {
            await fetchSource()
        }
    }

    func fetchSource() async {
        do {
            let url = URL(string: "https://apple.com")!

            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            sourceCode = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
        } catch {
            sourceCode = "Failed to fetch apple.com"
        }
    }
}
```

3- The third option is that Swift provides a dedicated `Task API` that lets us `call async functions` from a `synchronous function`.

- When you use something like `Task` you’re asking Swift to `run some async code`.

- If you don’t care about the result you have nothing to wait for – the task will start running immediately while your own function continues, and it will always run to completion even if you don’t store the active task somewhere.

- This means you’re `not awaiting the result of the task`, so you `won’t run the risk of being suspended`.

- When you actually want to `use any returned value from your task`, that’s when `await` is required.

- This time we’re going to `trigger the network fetch` using a `button press`, which `is synchronous by default`, so we’re going to wrap our work in a `Task`.

- This is possible because we don’t need to wait for the task to complete – it will always run to completion as soon as it is made, and will take care of updating the UI for us.

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var site = "https://"
    @State private var sourceCode = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            HStack {
                TextField("Website address", text: $site)
                    .textFieldStyle(.roundedBorder)
                Button("Go") {
                    Task {
                        await fetchSource()
                    }
                }
            }
            .padding()

            ScrollView {
                Text(sourceCode)
            }
        }
    }

    func fetchSource() async {
        do {
            let url = URL(string: site)!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            sourceCode = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self).trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines)
        } catch {
            sourceCode = "Failed to fetch \(site)"
        }
    }
}
```


## What is the performance cost of calling an async function?

- Whenever we use `await` to call an `async function`, we mark a potential suspension point in our code – we’re acknowledging that it’s entirely possible our function will be suspended, along with all its callers, while the work completes.

- In terms of performance, this is not free: `synchronous` and `asynchronous` functions use a different calling convention internally, with the `asynchronous variant being slightly less efficient`.

- The important thing to understand here is that `Swift cannot tell at compile time` whether an `await call will suspend or not`, and so the same (slightly) `more expensive calling convention is used` regardless of what actually takes place at runtime.

- However, `what happens at runtime depends on whether the call suspends` or not:

1- If a `suspension happens`, then Swift will pause the function and all its callers, which has a small performance cost. 

- These will then be resumed later, and ultimately whatever performance cost you pay for the suspension is like a rounding error compared to the performance gain provided by `async/await` even existing.

2- If a `suspension does not happen`, no pause will take place and your function will continue to run with the same efficiency and timings as a synchronous function.

- That last part carries an important side effect: `using await will not cause your code to wait for one runloop to go by before continuing`.

- If your code doesn’t actually suspend, the only cost to calling an asynchronous function is the slightly more expensive calling convention, and if your code does suspend then any cost is more or less irrelevant because you’ve gained so much extra performance thanks to the suspension happening in the first place.


## How to create and use async properties

- Just as Swift’s functions can be `asynchronous`, `computed properties can also be asynchronous`, attempting to access them must also use `await` or similar, and may also need `throws` if errors can be thrown when computing the property.

- This is what allows things like the `value` property of `Task` to work, it’s a simple property, but we must access it using `await` because it might not have completed yet.

- `Important`: This is `only possible on read-only computed properties`, attempting to provide a setter will cause a compile error.

- To demonstrate this, we could create a `RemoteFile` struct that stores a `URL` and a `type that conforms to Decodable`. 

- This struct won’t actually fetch the URL when the struct is created, but will instead dynamically fetch the content’s of the URL every time the property is requested so that we can update our UI dynamically.

- Tip: If you use `URLSession.shared` to fetch your data it will `automatically be cached`, so we’re going to create a custom `URL session` that always ignores local and remote caches to make sure our remote file is always fetched.

```swift
// First, a URLSession instance that never uses caches
extension URLSession {
    static let noCacheSession: URLSession = {
        let config = URLSessionConfiguration.default
        config.requestCachePolicy = .reloadIgnoringLocalAndRemoteCacheData
        return URLSession(configuration: config)
    }()
}

// Now our struct that will fetch and decode a URL every time we read its `contents` property
struct RemoteFile<T: Decodable> {
    let url: URL
    let type: T.Type

    var contents: T {
        get async throws {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.noCacheSession.data(from: url)
            return try JSONDecoder().decode(T.self, from: data)
        }
    }
}
```

- So, we’re fetching the URL’s contents every time `contents` is access, as opposed to storing the URL’s contents when a `RemoteFile` instance is created. 

- As a result, the property is marked both `async` and `throws` so that callers must use `await` or similar when accessing it.


## How to call an async function using async let

- Sometimes you want to run several `async operations` at the same time then wait for their results to come back, and the easiest way to do that is with `async let`.

- This lets you start several `async functions`, all of which begin running immediately, it’s `much more efficient than running them sequentially`.

- A common example of where this is useful is `when you have to make two or more network requests`, none of which relate to each other. 

- That is, if you need to get `Thing X` and `Thing Y` from a server, but `you don’t need to wait for X to return before you start fetching Y`.

- To demonstrate this, we could define a couple of structs to store data – `one to store a user’s account data`, and `one to store all the messages in their inbox`:

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}
```

- These two things can be fetched independently of each other, so rather than `fetching the user’s account details` then `fetching their message inbox` we want to `get them both together`.

- In this instance, rather than using a regular `await` call a better choice is `async let`, like this:

```swift
func loadData() async {
    
    async let (userData, _) = URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-24601.json")!)
    async let (messageData, _) = URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!)

    // more code to come
}
```

- That’s only a small amount of code, but there are three things I want to highlight in there:

1- Even though the `data(from:)` method is `async`, we don’t need to use `await` before it because that’s implied by `async let`.

2- The `data(from:)` method is also `throwing`, but we don’t need to use `try` to execute it because that gets pushed back to when we actually want to read its return value.

3- Both those network calls start immediately, but might complete in any order.

- Now we have two network requests in flight. 

- The next step is to wait for them to complete, decode their returned data into structs, and use that somehow.

- There are two things you need to remember:

1- Both our `data(from:)` calls might `throw`, so when we read those values we need to use `try`.

2- Both our `data(from:)` calls are `running concurrently` while our main `loadData()` function continues to execute, so we need to `read their values` using `await` in case they aren’t ready yet.

- So, we could complete our function by using `try await` for each of our network requests in turn, then print out the result:

```swift
func loadData() async {

    async let (userData, _) = URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-24601.json")!)
    async let (messageData, _) = URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!)

    do {
        let decoder = JSONDecoder()
        let user = try await decoder.decode(User.self, from: userData)
        let messages = try await decoder.decode([Message].self, from: messageData)
        print("User \(user.name) has \(messages.count) message(s).")
    } catch {
        print("Sorry, there was a network problem.")
    }
}

await loadData()
```

- The Swift compiler will automatically track which `async let` constants could `throw` errors and will enforce the use of `try` when reading their value.

- It doesn’t matter which form of `try` you use, so you can use `try`, `try?` or `try!` as appropriate.

- Tip: If you never try to read the value of a `throwing` `async let` call – i.e., if you’ve started the work but don’t care what it returns – then you don’t need to use `try` at all, which in turn means the function running the `async let` code might not need to handle errors at all.

- Although both our network requests are happening at the same time, we still need to wait for them to complete in some sort of order. 

- So, if you wanted to `update your user interface as soon as either user or messages arrived back` `async let` isn’t going to help by itself – you should look at the dedicated `Task` type instead.

- One complexity with `async let` is that `it captures any values it uses`, which means you might accidentally try to write code that isn’t safe. 

- Swift helps here by taking some steps to enforce that you aren’t trying to modify data unsafely.

- As an example, if we wanted to fetch the favorites for a user, we might have a function such as this one:

```swift
struct User: Decodable {
    let id: UUID
    let name: String
    let age: Int
}

struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}

func fetchFavorites(for user: User) async -> [Int] {

    print("Fetching favorites for \(user.name)…")

    do {
        async let (favorites, _) = URLSession.shared.data(from: URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-favorites.json")!)
        return try await JSONDecoder().decode([Int].self, from: favorites)
    } catch {
        return []
    }
}

let user = User(id: UUID(), name: "Taylor Swift", age: 26)
async let favorites = fetchFavorites(for: user)
await print("Found \(favorites.count) favorites.")
```

- That function accepts a `User` parameter so it can print a status message.

- But what happens if our `User` was created as a `variable` and captured by `async let`? 

- You can see this for yourself if you change the user:

```swift
var user = User(id: UUID(), name: "Taylor Swift", age: 26)
```

- Even though `it’s a struct`, the `user variable will be captured` rather than copied and so Swift will `throw up` the build error `“Reference to captured var 'user' in concurrently-executing code.”`

- To fix this we need to make it clear the struct cannot change by surprise, even when captured, `by making it a constant` rather than a variable.


## What is the difference between await and async let?

- Swift lets us perform `async operations` using both `await` and `async let`, but although they both `run some async code` they don’t quite run the same.

- `await` immediately waits for the work to complete so we can read its result, whereas `async let` does not.

- If you want to make two network requests where one relates to the other, you might have code like this:

```swift
let first = await requestFirstData()
let second = await requestSecondData(using: first)
```

- There the call to `requestSecondData()` cannot start until the call to `requestFirstData()` has completed and returned its value it just doesn’t make sense for those two to run simultaneously.

- If you’re making several completely different requests – perhaps you want to download the latest news, the weather forecast, and check whether an app update was available – then `those things do not rely on each other to complete` and would be great candidates for `async let`:

```swift
func getAppData() -> ([News], [Weather], Bool) {
    async let news = getNews()
    async let weather = getWeather()
    async let hasUpdate = getAppUpdateAvailable()
    return await (news, weather, hasUpdate)
}
```

- Use `await` when it’s important you have a value before continuing.

- Use `async let` when your work can continue without the value for the time being, you can always use `await` later on when it’s actually needed.


## Why we can not call async functions using async var?

- Swift’s `async let` syntax provides short, helpful syntax `for running lots of work concurrently`, allowing us to wait for them all later on. 

- However, it only works as `async let` – it’s not possible to use `async var`.

- If you think about it, this restriction makes sense, consider pseudocode like this:

```swift
func fetchUsername() async -> String {
    // complex networking here
    "Taylor Swift"
}

async var username = fetchUsername()

username = "Justin Bieber"

print("Username is \(username)")
```

- That attempts to `create a variable asynchronously`, then writes to it directly. 

- Have we cancelled the async work? 
- If not, when the async work completes will it overwrite our new value? 
- Do we still need to use await when reading the value even after we’ve explicitly set it?

- This kind of code would create all sorts of confusion, so `it’s just not allowed` – `async let` is our only option.


## How to use continuations to convert completion handlers into async functions

- Older Swift code uses `completion handlers` for `notifying us when some work has completed`, and sooner or later you’re going to have to use it from an `async` function – either because you’re using a library someone else created, or because it’s one of your own functions but updating it to `async` would take a lot of work.

- Swift uses `continuations` to solve this problem, allowing us to `create a bridge between older functions with completion handlers and newer async` code.

- To demonstrate this problem, here’s some code that attempts to fetch some JSON from a web server, decode it into an array of `Message` structs, then send it back using a `completion handler`:

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}

func fetchMessages(completion: @escaping ([Message]) -> Void) {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        if let data = data {
            if let messages = try? JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data) {
                completion(messages)
                return
            }
        }

        completion([])
    }.resume()
}
```

- Although the `dataTask(with:)` method does run our code on its own thread, this is `not an async function` in the sense of Swift’s `async/await` feature, which means it’s going to be messy to integrate into other code that does use modern `async` Swift.

- To fix this, Swift provides us with `continuations`, which `are special objects we pass into the completion handlers as captured values`. 

- Once the `completion handler fires`, we can either `return the finished value`, `throw an error`, or `send back a Result` that can be handled elsewhere.

- In the case of `fetchMessages()`, we want to write a `new async function` that calls the original, and `in its completion handler we’ll return whatever value was sent back`:

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}

func fetchMessages(completion: @escaping ([Message]) -> Void) {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        if let data = data {
            if let messages = try? JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data) {
                completion(messages)
                return
            }
        }

        completion([])
    }.resume()
}

func fetchMessages() async -> [Message] {
    await withCheckedContinuation { continuation in
        fetchMessages { messages in
            continuation.resume(returning: messages)
        }
    }
}

let messages = await fetchMessages()

print("Downloaded \(messages.count) messages.")
```

- Starting a `continuation` is done using the `withCheckedContinuation()` function, which passes into itself the `continuation` we need to work with.

- It’s called a `“checked” continuation` because `Swift checks that we’re using the continuation correctly`, which means abiding by one very simple, very important rule:

- `Your continuation must be resumed exactly once. Not zero times, and not twice or more times – exactly once.`

- If you `call` the `checked continuation twice or more`, Swift will cause your `program to halt – it will just crash`. 

- If you `fail to resume the continuation` at all, Swift will `print out a large warning` in your debug log similar to this: `“SWIFT TASK CONTINUATION MISUSE: fetchMessages() leaked its continuation!”`

- This is because `you’re leaving the task suspended`, `causing any resources it’s using to be held indefinitely`.

- However, if you have checked your code carefully and you’re sure it is correct, you can if you want replace the `withCheckedContinuation()` function with a call to `withUnsafeContinuation()`, which `works exactly the same` way but `doesn’t add the runtime cost of checking you’ve used the continuation correctly`.


## How to create continuations that can throw errors

- Swift provides `withCheckedContinuation()` and `withUnsafeContinuation()` to let us `create continuations that can’t throw errors`. 

- If the API you’re using `can throw errors` you should use their throwing equivalents: `withCheckedThrowingContinuation()` and `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation()`.

- Both of these replacement functions work identically to their non-throwing counterparts, except `now you need to catch any errors thrown inside the continuation`.

- So, first we’d define the errors we want to throw, then we’d write a newer `async` version of `fetchMessages()` using `withCheckedThrowingContinuation()`, and handling the “no messages” error using whatever code we wanted:

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}

func fetchMessages(completion: @escaping ([Message]) -> Void) {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!

    URLSession.shared.dataTask(with: url) { data, response, error in
        if let data = data {
            if let messages = try? JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data) {
                completion(messages)
                return
            }
        }

        completion([])
    }.resume()
}

// An example error we can throw
enum FetchError: Error {
    case noMessages
}

func fetchMessages() async -> [Message] {
    do {
        return try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            fetchMessages { messages in
                if messages.isEmpty {
                    continuation.resume(throwing: FetchError.noMessages)
                } else {
                    continuation.resume(returning: messages)
                }
            }
        }
    } catch {
        return [
            Message(id: 1, from: "Tom", message: "Welcome to MySpace! I'm your new friend.")
        ]
    }
}

let messages = await fetchMessages()
print("Downloaded \(messages.count) messages.")
```

- That detects a lack of messages and sends back a welcome message instead, but you could also `let the error propagate upwards` by `removing do/catch` and making the new `fetchMessages()` function `throwing`.

- Tip: Using `withUnsafeThrowingContinuation()` comes with all the same warnings as using `withUnsafeContinuation()` – you should `only switch over to it if it’s causing a performance problem`.


## How to store continuations to be resumed later

- Many of Apple’s frameworks report back success or failure using multiple different delegate callback methods rather than completion handlers, which means a simple continuation won’t work.

- As a simple example, if you were implementing `WKNavigationDelegate` to handle navigating around a `WKWebView` you would implement methods like this:

```swift
func webView(_ webView: WKWebView, didFinish navigation: WKNavigation!) {
    // our work succeeded
}

func webView(WKWebView, didFail: WKNavigation!, withError: Error) {
    // our work failed
}
```

- Rather than receiving the result of our work through a single completion closure, we instead get the result in two different places.

- In this situation we need to do a little more work to create `async functions` using `continuations`, because `we need to be able to resume the continuation` in either method.

- To solve this problem you need to know that `continuations are just structs with a specific generic type`.

- For example, a `checked continuation that succeeds with a string and never throws an error` has the type `CheckedContinuation<String, Never>`, and an `unchecked continuation that returns an integer array and can throw errors` has the type `UnsafeContinuation<[Int], Error>`.

- All this is important because to solve our delegate callback problem `we need to stash away a continuation in one method` – when we trigger some functionality – then `resume it from different methods` based on `whether our code succeeds or fails`.

- So we’re going to create an `ObservableObject` to wrap `Core Location`, making it `easier to request the user’s location`.

- First, add these imports to your code so `we can read their location`, and also `use SwiftUI’s LocationButton to get standardized UI`:

```swift
import CoreLocation
import CoreLocationUI
```

- Second, we’re going to create a small part of a `LocationManager` class that has two properties:

1- one for `storing a continuation to track whether we have their location coordinate or an error`.

2- one to `track an instance of CLLocationManager that does the work of finding the user`. 

- This also needs a small initializer so the `CLLocationManager` knows to report location updates to us.

```swift
@MainActor
class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    var locationContinuation: CheckedContinuation<CLLocationCoordinate2D?, Error>?
    let manager = CLLocationManager()

    override init() {
        super.init()
        manager.delegate = self
    }

    // More code to come
}
```

- Because that observable object is used with SwiftUI, I’ve marked it with the `@MainActor attribute` to `avoid updating the user interface on a background thread`.

- Third, we need to `add an async function` that requests the user’s location. 

- This needs to be wrapped inside a `withCheckedThrowingContinuation()` call, so that `Swift creates a continuation we can stash away and use later`.

```swift
func requestLocation() async throws -> CLLocationCoordinate2D? {
    try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
        locationContinuation = continuation
        manager.requestLocation()
    }
}
```

- And finally we need to implement the two methods that might be called after we request the user’s location: `didUpdateLocations` will be `called if their location was received`, and `didFailWithError otherwise`.

- `Both of these need to resume our continuation`, with `the former sending back the first location coordinate we were given`, and `the latter throwing whatever error occurred`:

```swift
func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
    locationContinuation?.resume(returning: locations.first?.coordinate)
}

func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {
    locationContinuation?.resume(throwing: error)
}
```

- So, `by storing our continuation as a property we’re able to resume it in two different places` – `once where things go to plan`, and `once where things go wrong` for whatever reason.

- Either way, `no matter what happens our continuation resumes exactly once`.

- At this point our `continuation wrapper is complete`, so we can use it inside a SwiftUI view. 

- If we put everything together, here’s the end result:

```swift
@MainActor
class LocationManager: NSObject, ObservableObject, CLLocationManagerDelegate {
    var locationContinuation: CheckedContinuation<CLLocationCoordinate2D?, Error>?
    let manager = CLLocationManager()

    override init() {
        super.init()
        manager.delegate = self
    }

    func requestLocation() async throws -> CLLocationCoordinate2D? {
        try await withCheckedThrowingContinuation { continuation in
            locationContinuation = continuation
            manager.requestLocation()
        }
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didUpdateLocations locations: [CLLocation]) {
        locationContinuation?.resume(returning: locations.first?.coordinate)
    }

    func locationManager(_ manager: CLLocationManager, didFailWithError error: Error) {
        locationContinuation?.resume(throwing: error)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var locationManager = LocationManager()

    var body: some View {
        LocationButton {
            Task {
                if let location = try? await locationManager.requestLocation() {
                    print("Location: \(location)")
                } else {
                    print("Location unknown.")
                }
            }
        }
        .frame(height: 44)
        .foregroundColor(.white)
        .clipShape(Capsule())
        .padding()
    }
}
```


## How to fix the error “async call in a function that does not support concurrency”

- This error occurs when you’ve `tried to call an async function from a synchronous function`, which is not allowed in Swift.

- `Asynchronous functions` must be able to suspend themselves and their callers, and `synchronous functions` simply don’t know how to do that.

- If your `asynchronous work needs to be waited` for, you don’t have much of a choice but to `mark your current code as also being async so that you can use await as normal`.

- However, sometimes this can result in a bit of an `“async infection”` – you mark `one function as being async`, which `means its caller needs to be async too`, `as does its caller, and so on`, until you’ve turned one error into 50.

- In this situation, you can create a dedicated `Task` to solve the problem.

```swift
func doAsyncWork() async {
    print("Doing async work")
}

func doRegularWork() {
    Task {
        await doAsyncWork()
    }
}

doRegularWork()
```

- `Tasks` like this one are `created and run immediately`. 

- We `aren’t waiting for the task to complete`, so we `shouldn’t use await when creating it`.


# Sequences and streams


## What is the difference between Sequence AsyncSequence and AsyncStream?

- Swift provides `several ways of receiving a potentially endless flow of data`, allowing us to `read values one by one`, or `loop over them` using `for`, `while`, or similar.

- The simplest is the `Sequence protocol`, which continually returns values until the sequence is terminated by returning `nil`.

- Lots of things conform to `Sequence`, including `arrays, strings, ranges, Data` and more.

- Through protocol extensions `Sequence` also gives us access to a variety of methods, including `contains()`, `filter()`, `map()`, and others.

- The `AsyncSequence protocol` is almost identical to `Sequence`, with the important exception that `each element in the sequence is returned asynchronously`.

- It actually has two major impacts on the way they work.

1- Reading a value from the `async sequence` must use `await` so the `sequence can suspend itself` while reading its next value. This might be performing some complex work, or perhaps fetching data from a server.

2- More advanced `async sequences` known as `async streams` might `generate values faster than you can read them`, in which case you can `either discard the extra values or buffer them to be read later on`.

- In the first case think of it like `your code wanting values faster than the async sequence can make them`. 

- In the second case it’s more like `the async sequence generating data faster than than your code can read them`.

- Otherwise, `Sequence` and `AsyncSequence` have lots in common: 

- The `code to create a custom one yourself is almost the same`, `both can throw errors if you want`, `both get access to common functionality` such as `map()`, `filter()`, `contains()`, and `reduce()`, and you can also use `break` or `continue` to exit loops over either of them.


## How to loop over an AsyncSequence using for await

- You can loop over an `AsyncSequence` using Swift’s regular loop types, `for`, `while`, and `repeat`.

- Whenever you `read a value from the async sequence` you must use either `await` or `try await` depending on whether it can throw errors or not.

- As an example, `URL` has a built-in `lines` property that generates an `async sequence` of all the lines directly from a URL. 

- This does a lot of work internally: making the network request, fetching part of the data, converting it into a string, sending it back for us to use, then repeating fetch, convert, and send again and again until the server stops sending back data.

```swift
func fetchUsers() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/users.csv")!

    for try await line in url.lines {
        print("Received user: \(line)")
    }
}

try? await fetchUsers()
```

- Notice how we must use `try along with await`, because `fetching data from the network might throw errors`.

- Using `lines` returns a specialized type called `AsyncLineSequence`, which returns individual lines from the download as strings. 

- Because our source happens to be a `comma-separated values file (CSV)`, we can write code to read the values from each line easily enough:

```swift
func printUsers() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/users.csv")!

    for try await line in url.lines {
        let parts = line.split(separator: ",")
        guard parts.count == 4 else { continue }

        guard let id = Int(parts[0]) else { continue }
        let firstName = parts[1]
        let lastName = parts[2]
        let country = parts[3]

        print("Found user #\(id): \(firstName) \(lastName) from \(country)")
    }
}

try? await printUsers()
```

- Just like a `regular sequence`, using an `async sequence` in this way effectively generates an `iterator` then calls `next()` on it repeatedly until it `returns nil`, at which point the loop finishes.

- If you want more control over how the sequence is read, you can of course `create your own iterator` then call `next()` whenever you want and as often as you want. 

- Again, it will send back `nil` when the `sequence is empty`, at which point you should `stop calling it`.

- For example, we could `read the first user from our CSV and treat them specially`, `then read the next four users and do something specific for them`, `then finally reduce all the remainder down into an array of other users`:

```swift
func printUsers() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/users.csv")!

    var iterator = url.lines.makeAsyncIterator()

    if let line = try await iterator.next() {
        print("The first user is \(line)")
    }

    for i in 2...5 {
        if let line = try await iterator.next() {
            print("User #\(i): \(line)")
        }
    }

    var remainingResults = [String]()

    while let result = try await iterator.next() {
        remainingResults.append(result)
    }

    print("There were \(remainingResults.count) other users.")
}

try? await printUsers()
```


## How to manipulate an AsyncSequence using map() filter() and more

- `AsyncSequence` has implementations of many of the same methods that come with `Sequence`, but how they operate varies.

- Some return a single value that fulfills your request, such as `requesting the first value from the async sequence`. 

- Others return a `new kind of async sequence`, such as filtering values as they arrive.

- This distinction in turn `affects how they are called`: 

- `returning a single value` requires you to `await at the call site`.

- `returning a new async sequence` requires you to `await later on when you’re reading values from the new sequence`.

- `Mapping an async sequence` creates a new async sequence with the type `AsyncMapSequence`, which stores both your `original async sequence` and also `the transformation function you want to use`.

- You effectively put the transformation into a chain of work: 

- `The sequence now fetches an item, transforms it, then sends it back`.

- We could map over the lines from a `URL` to make each line uppercase, like this:

```swift
func shoutQuotes() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
    
    let uppercaseLines = url.lines.map(\.localizedUppercase)

    for try await line in uppercaseLines {
        print(line)
    }
}

try? await shoutQuotes()
```

- This also works for converting between types using `map()`, like this:

```swift
struct Quote {
    let text: String
}

func printQuotes() async throws {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!

    let quotes = url.lines.map(Quote.init)

    for try await quote in quotes {
        print(quote.text)
    }
}

try? await printQuotes()
```

- Alternatively, we could use `filter()` to check every line with a predicate, and process only those that pass. 

- Using our quotes, we could print only anonymous quotes like this:

```swift
func printAnonymousQuotes() async throws {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
    
    let anonymousQuotes = url.lines.filter { $0.contains("Anonymous") }

    for try await line in anonymousQuotes {
        print(line)
    }
}

try? await printAnonymousQuotes()
```

- Or we could use `prefix()` to read just the first five values from an async sequence:

```swift
func printTopQuotes() async throws {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
    
    let topQuotes = url.lines.prefix(5)

    for try await line in topQuotes {
        print(line)
    }
}

try? await printTopQuotes()
```

- And of course you can also combine these together in varying ways depending on what result you want. 

- For example, this will filter for anonymous quotes, pick out the first five, then make them uppercase:

```swift
func printQuotes() async throws {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!

    let anonymousQuotes = url.lines.filter { $0.contains("Anonymous") }
    let topAnonymousQuotes = anonymousQuotes.prefix(5)
    let shoutingTopAnonymousQuotes = topAnonymousQuotes.map(\.localizedUppercase)

    for try await line in shoutingTopAnonymousQuotes {
        print(line)
    }
}

try? await printQuotes()
```

- Just like using a regular `Sequence`, `the order you apply these transformations matters` – putting `prefix()` before `filter()` will pick out the first five quotes then select only the ones that are anonymous, which might produce fewer results.

- Each of these transformation methods `returns a new type specific to what the method does`, so calling `map()` returns an `AsyncMapSequence`, calling `filter()` returns an `AsyncFilterSequence`, and calling `prefix()` returns an `AsyncPrefixSequence`.

- When you stack multiple transformations together – for example, `a filter, then a prefix, then a map`– this will inevitably produce a fairly `complex return type`, so if you intend to send back one of the complex async sequences you should consider an opaque return type like this:

```swift
func getQuotes() async -> some AsyncSequence {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
    
    let anonymousQuotes = url.lines.filter { $0.contains("Anonymous") }
    
    let topAnonymousQuotes = anonymousQuotes.prefix(5)
    
    let shoutingTopAnonymousQuotes = topAnonymousQuotes.map(\.localizedUppercase)
    
    return shoutingTopAnonymousQuotes
}

let result = await getQuotes()

do {
    for try await quote in result {
        print(quote)
    }
} catch {
    print("Error fetching quotes")
}
```

- All the transformations so far have created `new async sequences` and so we `did not needed to use them with await`, but many also produce a single value. 

- These must use `await` in order to `suspend until all parts of the sequence have been returned`, and may also need to use `try` if the `sequence is throwing`.

- For example, `allSatisfy()` will check whether `all elements in an async sequence pass a predicate of your choosing`:

```swift
func checkQuotes() async throws {
    
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
    
    let noShortQuotes = try await url.lines.allSatisfy { $0.count > 30 }
    
    print(noShortQuotes)
}

try? await checkQuotes()
```

- Important: As with regular sequences, in order to return a correct value `allSatisfy()` must have fetched every value in the sequence first, and therefore `using it with an infinite sequence will never return a value`. 

- The same is true of other similar functions, such as `min()`, `max()`, and `reduce()`, so be careful.

- You can of course `combine methods that create new async sequences and return a single value`, for example to fetch lots of random numbers, convert them to integers, then find the largest:

```swift
func printHighestNumber() async throws {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/random-numbers.txt")!

    if let highest = try await url.lines.compactMap(Int.init).max() {
        print("Highest number: \(highest)")
    } else {
        print("No number was the highest.")
    }
}

try? await printHighestNumber()
```

- Or to sum all the numbers:

```swift
func sumRandomNumbers() async throws {

    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/random-numbers.txt")!
    
    let sum = try await url.lines.compactMap(Int.init).reduce(0, +)
    
    print("Sum of numbers: \(sum)")
}

try? await sumRandomNumbers()
```


## How to create a custom AsyncSequence

- There are only three differences between creating an `AsyncSequence` and creating a regular `Sequence`:

1- We need to conform to the `AsyncSequence` and `AsyncIteratorProtocol` protocols.

2- The `next()` method of our `iterator` must be marked `async`.

3- We need to create a `makeAsyncIterator()` method rather than `makeIterator()`.


- That last point technically allows us to create one type that is both a synchronous and asynchronous sequence, although I’m not sure when that would be a good idea.

- First, the simple one, which is an `async sequence` that doubles numbers every time `next()` is called:

```swift
struct DoubleGenerator: AsyncSequence, AsyncIteratorProtocol {
    
    typealias Element = Int
    
    var current = 1

    mutating func next() async -> Element? {
        defer { current &*= 2 }

        if current < 0 {
            return nil
        } else {
            return current
        }
    }

    func makeAsyncIterator() -> DoubleGenerator {
        self
    }
}

let sequence = DoubleGenerator()

for await number in sequence {
    print(number)
}
```

- Tip: In case you haven’t seen it before, `&*=` multiples with overflow, meaning that `rather than running out of room when the value goes beyond the highest number of a 64-bit integer, it will instead flip around to be negative`. 

- We use this to our advantage, returning `nil` when we reach that point.

- If you prefer having a separate iterator struct, that also works as with `Sequence` and you don’t need to adjust the calling code:

```swift
struct DoubleGenerator: AsyncSequence {
    typealias Element = Int

    struct AsyncIterator: AsyncIteratorProtocol {
        var current = 1

        mutating func next() async -> Element? {
            defer { current &*= 2 }

            if current < 0 {
                return nil
            } else {
                return current
            }
        }
    }

    func makeAsyncIterator() -> AsyncIterator {
        AsyncIterator()
    }
}

let sequence = DoubleGenerator()

for await number in sequence {
    print(number)
}
```

- Now let’s look at a more complex example, which will periodically fetch a URL that’s either local or remote, and send back any values that have changed from the previous request.

- This is more complex for various reasons:

1- Our `next()` method will be marked `throws`, so callers are responsible for handling loop errors.

2- Between checks we’re going to sleep for some number of seconds, so we don’t overload the network. This will be configurable when creating the watcher, but internally it will use `Task.sleep()`.

3- If we get data back and it hasn’t changed, we go around our loop again – wait for some number of seconds, re-fetch the URL, then check again.

4- Otherwise, if there has been a change between the old and new data, we `overwrite our old data with the new data and send it back`.

5- If no data is returned from our request, we immediately terminate the `iterator` by sending back `nil`.

6- This is important: once our `iterator ends`, any further attempt to call `next()` must also return `nil`. This is part of the design of `AsyncSequence`, so stick to it.

- To add to the complexity a little, `Task.sleep()` `measures its time in nanoseconds`, so `to sleep for one second you should specify 1 billion as the sleep amount`.

- It’s also particularly powerful when combined with `SwiftUI’s task()` modifier, because the `network fetches will automatically start when a view is shown and cancelled when it disappears`. 

- This allows you to constantly watch for new data coming in, and stream it directly into your UI.

- Creating a `URLWatcher` struct that conforms to the `AsyncSequence` protocol, along with an example of it being used to display a list of users in a SwiftUI view:

```swift
struct URLWatcher: AsyncSequence, AsyncIteratorProtocol {
    typealias Element = Data

    let url: URL
    let delay: Int
    private var comparisonData: Data?
    private var isActive = true

    init(url: URL, delay: Int = 10) {
        self.url = url
        self.delay = delay
    }

    mutating func next() async throws -> Element? {
        // Once we're inactive always return nil immediately
        guard isActive else { return nil }

        if comparisonData == nil {
            // If this is our first iteration, return the initial value
            comparisonData = try await fetchData()
        } else {
            // Otherwise, sleep for a while and see if our data changed
            while true {
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(delay) * 1_000_000_000)
                let latestData = try await fetchData()

                if latestData != comparisonData {
                    // New data is different from previous data,
                    // so update previous data and send it back
                    comparisonData = latestData
                    break
                }
            }
        }

        if comparisonData == nil {
            isActive = false
            return nil
        } else {
            return comparisonData
        }
    }

    private func fetchData() async throws -> Element {
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return data
    }

    func makeAsyncIterator() -> URLWatcher {
        self
    }
}

// As an example of URLWatcher in action, try something like this:
struct User: Identifiable, Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let name: String
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var users = [User]()

    var body: some View {
        List(users) { user in
            Text(user.name)
        }
        .task {
            // continuously check the URL watcher for data
            await fetchUsers()
        }
    }

    func fetchUsers() async {
        let url = URL(fileURLWithPath: "FILENAMEHERE.json")
        let urlWatcher = URLWatcher(url: url, delay: 3)

        do {
            for try await data in urlWatcher {
                try withAnimation {
                    users = try JSONDecoder().decode([User].self, from: data)
                }
            }
        } catch {
            // just bail out
        }
    }
}
```

- To make that work in your own project, replace “FILENAMEHERE” with the location of a local file you can test with. 

- For example, I might use /Users/twostraws/users.json, giving that file the following example contents:

```swift
[
    {
        "id": 1,
        "name": "Paul"
    }
]
```

- When the code first runs the list will show Paul, but if you edit the JSON file and re-save with extra users, they will just slide into the SwiftUI list automatically.


## How to convert an AsyncSequence into a Sequence

- Swift does not provide a built-in way of converting an `AsyncSequence` into a regular `Sequence`, but often you’ll want to make this conversion yourself so you `don’t need to keep awaiting results to come back in the future`.

- The easiest thing to do is call `reduce(into:)` on the sequence, appending each item to an array of the sequence’s element type. 

- To make this more reusable, I’d recommend adding an extension such as this one:

```swift
extension AsyncSequence {

    func collect() async rethrows -> [Element] {
        try await reduce(into: [Element]()) { $0.append($1) }
    }
    
}
```

- With that in place, you can now call `collect()` on any `async sequence` in order to `get a simple array of its values`. 

- Because this is an `async operation`, you must call it using `await` like so:


```swift
extension AsyncSequence {
    func collect() async rethrows -> [Element] {
        try await reduce(into: [Element]()) { $0.append($1) }
    }
}

func getNumberArray() async throws -> [Int] {
    let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/random-numbers.txt")!
    let numbers = url.lines.compactMap(Int.init)
    return try await numbers.collect()
}

if let numbers = try? await getNumberArray() {
    for number in numbers {
        print(number)
    }
}
```

- Tip: Because we’ve made `collect()` use `rethrows`, you only need to call it using `try` if the call to `reduce()` would normally throw, so if you have an `async sequence` that doesn’t throw errors you can skip try entirely.


# Task and TaskGroup


## What are tasks and task groups?

- Using `async/await` in Swift allows us to `write asynchronous code` that is easy to read and understand, but by itself it `doesn’t enable us to run anything concurrently` – even with several CPU cores working hard, `async/await code would still execute sequentially`.

- To `create actual concurrency` – to `provide the ability for multiple pieces of work to run at the same time` – Swift provides us with two specific types for constructing and managing concurrency in a way that makes it easier to use: `Task` and `TaskGroup`.

- Although the types themselves aren’t complex, they unlock a lot of power and flexibility, and sit at the core of how we use concurrency with Swift.

- Which you choose – `Task` or `TaskGroup` – depends on the goal of your work:

- If you want one or two independent pieces of work to start, then `Task` is the right choice.

- If you want to split up one job into several concurrent operations then `TaskGroup` is a better fit.

- `Task groups` work best when their individual operations `return exactly the same kind of data`, but with a little extra effort you can coerce them into supporting heterogenous data types.

- Although you might not realize it, `you’re using tasks` every time you write any `async code` in Swift.

- You see, `all async functions run as part of a task` whether or not we explicitly ask for it to happen.

- Even using `async let` is syntactic sugar for `creating a task then waiting for its result`.

- This is why `if you use multiple sequential async let calls they will all start executing immediately` while the rest of your code continues.

- Both `Task` and `TaskGroup` can be created with `one of four priority levels`: 

- `high` is the most important, then `medium`, `low`, and finally `background` at the bottom.

- Task priorities allow the system to adjust the order in which it executes work, meaning that important work can happen before unimportant work.

- Tip: If you’ve been doing iOS programming for a while, you may prefer to use the more familiar `quality of service` priorities from `DispatchQueue`, which are `userInitiated` and `utility` in place of `high` and `low` respectively. 

- There is no equivalent to the old `userInteractive` priority, which `is now exclusively reserved for the user interface`.


## How to create and run a task

- Swift `Task` struct lets us `start running some work immediately`, and `optionally wait for the result to be returned`. 

- And it is optional: sometimes you don’t care about the result of the task, or sometimes the task automatically updates some external value when it completes, so you can just use them as “fire and forget” operations if you need to. 

- This makes them `a great way to run async code from a synchronous function`.

- First, let’s look at an example where we `create two tasks back to back`, then `wait for them both to complete`. 

- This will fetch data from two different URLs, decode them into two different structs, then print a summary of the results, all to simulate a user starting up a game – what are the latest news updates, and what are the current highest scores?

```swift
struct NewsItem: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let url: URL
}

struct HighScore: Decodable {
    let name: String
    let score: Int
}

func fetchUpdates() async {

    let newsTask = Task { () -> [NewsItem] in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/headlines.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode([NewsItem].self, from: data)
    }

    let highScoreTask = Task { () -> [HighScore] in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/scores.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return try JSONDecoder().decode([HighScore].self, from: data)
    }

    do {
        let news = try await newsTask.value
        let highScores = try await highScoreTask.value
        
        print("Latest news loaded with \(news.count) items.")

        if let topScore = highScores.first {
            print("\(topScore.name) has the highest score with \(topScore.score), out of \(highScores.count) total results.")
        }
    } catch {
        print("There was an error loading user data.")
    }
    
}

await fetchUpdates()
```

- Let’s unpick the key parts:

1- Creating and running a task is done by using its initializer, passing in the work you want to do.

2- Tasks don’t always need to return a value, but when they do chances are you’ll need to declare exactly what as you create the task – I’ve said `() -> [NewsItem]` in, for example.

3- As soon as you create the task it will start running.

4- The entire task is run concurrently with your other code, which means it might be able to run in parallel too. In our case, that means fetching and decoding the data happens inside the task, which keeps our main `fetchUpdates()` function free.

5- If you want to read the return value of a task, you need to access its `value` property using `await`. In our case our task could also throw errors because we’re accessing the network, so we need to use `try` as well.

6- Once you’ve copied out the value from your task you can use that normally without needing `await` or `try` again, although subsequent accesses to the task itself – e.g. `newsTask.value` – will need `try await` because Swift can’t statically determine that the value is already present.


- Both tasks in that example returned a value, but that’s not a requirement – the “fire and forget” approach allows us to create a task without storing it, and Swift will ensure it runs until completion correctly.

- To demonstrate this, we could make a small SwiftUI program to fetch a user’s inbox when a button is pressed. 
- `Button actions are not async functions`, so we need to `launch a new task inside the action`. 
- The `task` can `call async functions`, but in this instance we don’t actually care about the result so we’re not going to store the task – the function it calls will handle updating our SwiftUI view.

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let text: String
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var messages = [Message]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            Group {
                if messages.isEmpty {
                    Button("Load Messages") {
                        Task {
                            await loadMessages()
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    List(messages) { message in
                        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                            Text(message.from)
                                .font(.headline)

                            Text(message.text)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Inbox")
        }
    }
    
    func loadMessages() async {
        do {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/messages.json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            messages = try JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data)
        } catch {
            messages = [
                Message(id: 0, from: "Failed to load inbox.", text: "Please try again later.")
            ]
        }
    }
    
}
```

- Even though that code isn’t so different from the previous example, I still want to pick out a few things:

1- Creating the new `task` is what allows us to `start calling an async function even though the button’s action is a synchronous function`.

2- The `lifetime of the task is not bound by the button’s action closure`. So, even though the closure will finish immediately, the task it created will carry on running to completion.

3- We aren’t trying to read a return value from the task, or storing it anywhere. This task doesn’t actually return anything, and doesn’t need to.

- I know it’s a not a lot of code, but between `Task`, `async/await`, and `SwiftUI` a lot of work is happening on our behalf. 

- Remember, when we use `await` we’re signaling a potential suspension point, and when our functions resume they might be on the same thread as before or they might not.

- In this case there are potentially four thread swaps happening in our code:

1- All UI work runs on the main thread, so the button’s action closure will fire on the main thread.

2- Although we create the task on the main thread, the work we pass to it will execute on a background thread.

3- Inside `loadMessages()` we use `await` to load our URL data, and when that resumes we have another potential thread switch – we might be on the same background thread as before, or on a different background thread.

4- Finally, the `messages` property uses the `@State` property wrapper, which will automatically update its value on the main thread. So, even though we assign to it on a background thread, the actual update will get silently pushed back to the main thread.

- Best of all, we don’t have to care about this – we don’t need to know how the system is balancing the threads, or even that the threads exist, because Swift and SwiftUI take care of that for us. 

- In fact, the concept of `tasks` is so thoroughly baked into SwiftUI that there’s a dedicated `task()` modifier that makes them even easier to use.


## What is the difference between a task and a detached task?

- If you create a new `task` using the regular `Task` initializer, your work starts running immediately and inherits the priority of the caller, any task local values, and its actor context. 

- On the other hand, `detached tasks` also start work immediately, but do not inherit the priority or other information from the caller.

- The Swift Evolution proposal for `async let`: “`Task.detached` most of the time should not be used at all.”, getting that out of the way up front so you don’t spend time learning about `detached tasks`, only to realize you probably shouldn’t use them!

- Let’s dig in to our three differences: `priority`, `task local values`, and `actor isolation`.

- The `priority` part is straightforward: `if you’re inside a user-initiated task and create a new task, it will also have a priority of user-initiated`, whereas `creating a new detached task would give a nil priority unless you specifically asked for something`.

- `Task local values` allow us to `share a specific value everywhere inside one specific task` – they are like static properties on a type, except `rather than everything sharing that property, each task has its own value`.

- `Detached tasks` do not inherit the task local values of their parent because they do not have a parent.

- The `actor context` part is more important and more complex. When you `create a regular task from inside an actor it will be isolated to that actor`, which means `you can use other parts of the actor synchronously`:

```swift
actor User {

    func login() {
        Task {
            if authenticate(user: "taytay89", password: "n3wy0rk") {
                print("Successfully logged in.")
            } else {
                print("Sorry, something went wrong.")
            }
        }
    }

    func authenticate(user: String, password: String) -> Bool {
        // Complicated logic here
        return true
    }
}

let user = User()
await user.login()
```

- In comparison, a `detached task` `runs concurrently with all other code, including the actor that created it` – it effectively has no parent, and therefore `has greatly restricted access to the data inside the actor`.

- So, if we were to rewrite the previous actor to use a `detached task`, it would need to call `authenticate()` like this:

```swift
actor User {

    func login() {
        Task.detached {
            if await self.authenticate(user: "taytay89", password: "n3wy0rk") {
                print("Successfully logged in.")
            } else {
                print("Sorry, something went wrong.")
            }
        }
    }

    func authenticate(user: String, password: String) -> Bool {
        // Complicated logic here
        return true
    }
}

let user = User()
await user.login()
```

- This distinction is particularly important when you are running on the `main actor`, which will be the case if you’re responding to a button click for example. 

- The rules here might not be immediately obvious, so I want to show you some examples of what is allowed and what is not allowed, and more importantly explain why each is the case.

- First, if you’re changing the value of an `@State` property, you can do so using a regular task like this:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = "Anonymous"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, \(name)!")
            Button("Authenticate") {
                Task {
                    name = "Taylor"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Note: The `Task` here is of course not needed because we’re just setting a local value; I’m just trying to illustrate how regular tasks and detached tasks are different.

- In fact, because `@State` guarantees `it’s safe to change its value on any thread`, we can use a `detached task` instead even though it `won’t inherit actor isolation`:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var name = "Anonymous"

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, \(name)!")
            Button("Authenticate") {
                Task.detached {
                    name = "Taylor"
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
}
```

- The rules change when we switch to an `observable object` that publishes changes. 

- As soon as you add any `@ObservedObject` or `@StateObject` property wrappers to a view, `Swift will automatically infer that the whole view must also run on the main actor.`

- This makes sense if you think about it: `changes published by observable objects must update the UI on the main thread`, and because any part of the view might try to adjust your object the only safe approach is for the whole view to run on the main actor.

- So, this means `we can modify a view model` from inside a task created inside a SwiftUI view:

```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var name = "Hello"
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var model = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Hello, \(model.name)!")
            Button("Authenticate") {
                Task {
                    model.name = "Taylor"
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- However, we cannot use `Task.detached` here – `Swift will throw up an error that a property isolated to global actor 'MainActor' can not be mutated from a non-isolated context`. 

- In simpler terms, our `view model updates the UI and so must be on the main actor`, but our `detached task does not belong to that actor`.

- At this point, you might wonder why detached tasks would have any use. Well, consider this code:

```swift
class ViewModel: ObservableObject { }

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject private var model = ViewModel()

    var body: some View {
        Button("Authenticate", action: doWork)
    }

    func doWork() {
        Task {
            for i in 1...10_000 {
                print("In Task 1: \(i)")
            }
        }

        Task {
            for i in 1...10_000 {
                print("In Task 2: \(i)")
            }
        }
    }
    
}
```

- That’s the simplest piece of code that demonstrates the usefulness of `detached tasks`: `a SwiftUI view monitoring an empty view model`, plus a `button that launches a couple of tasks to print out text`.

- When that runs, you’ll see `“In Task 1” printed 10,000 times`, then `“In Task 2” printed 10,000 times` – even though `we have created two tasks, they are executing sequentially`. 

- This happens because our `@StateObject` `view model` `forces the entire view onto the main actor`, meaning that `it can only do one thing at a time`.

- In contrast, if you change both `Task` initializers to `Task.detached`, you’ll see `“In Task 1” and “In Task 2” get intermingled as both execute at the same time`. 

- Without any need for actor isolation, `Swift can run those tasks concurrently` – using a `detached task` has allowed us to shed our attachment to the main actor.

- Although `detached tasks` do have very specific uses, generally I think `they should be your last port of call` – use them only if you’ve tried both a regular `task` and `async let`, and neither solved your problem.


## How to get a Result from a task

- If you want to read the return value from a `Task` directly, you should read its `value` using `await`, or use `try await` if it has a throwing operation.

- However, all `tasks` also have a `result` property that returns an instance of Swift’s `Result` struct, generic over the type returned by the task as well as whether it might contain an error or not.

- To demonstrate this, we could write some code that `creates a task to fetch and decode a string from a URL`. 

- To start with we’re going to make this task throw errors if the download fails, or if the data can’t be converted to a string.

```swift
enum LoadError: Error {
    case fetchFailed, decodeFailed
}

func fetchQuotes() async {

    let downloadTask = Task { () -> String in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
        let data: Data

        do {
            (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        } catch {
            throw LoadError.fetchFailed
        }

        if let string = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
            return string
        } else {
            throw LoadError.decodeFailed
        }
    }

    let result = await downloadTask.result

    do {
        let string = try result.get()
        print(string)
    } catch LoadError.fetchFailed {
        print("Unable to fetch the quotes.")
    } catch LoadError.decodeFailed {
        print("Unable to convert quotes to text.")
    } catch {
        print("Unknown error.")
    }
}

await fetchQuotes()
```

- There’s not a lot of code there, but there are a few things I want to point out as being important:

1- Our `task` might `return a string`, but also might `throw one of two errors`. So, when we ask for its `result` property we’ll be given a `Result<String, Error>`.

2- Although we need to use `await` to get the `result`, `we don’t need to use try` even though there could be errors there. This is because we’re just reading out the result, not trying to read the successful value.

3- We call `get()` on the `Result` object to read the successful, but that’s when `try` is needed because it’s when Swift checks whether an error occurred or not.

4- When it comes to catching errors, we need a “catch everything” block at the end, even though we know we’ll only throw `LoadError`.


- That last point hits us because Swift isn’t able to evaluate the task to see exactly what kinds of error are thrown inside, and there’s no way of adding that annotation ourself because Swift doesn’t support typed throws.

- If you don’t care what errors are thrown, or don’t mind digging through Foundation’s various errors yourself, you can avoid handling errors in the task and just let them propagate up:

```swift
func fetchQuotes() async {

    let downloadTask = Task { () -> String in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/quotes.txt")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
    }

    let result = await downloadTask.result

    do {
        let string = try result.get()
        print(string)
    } catch {
        print("Unknown error.")
    }
}

await fetchQuotes()
```

- The main take aways here are:

1- All tasks can return a `Result` if you want.

2- For the error type, the `Result` will either contain `Error` or `Never`.

3- Although we need to use `await` to get the result, we don’t need to use `try` until we try to get the success value inside.

- Many places where `Result` was useful are now better served through `async/await`, but `Result` is still `useful for storing in a single value the success or failure of some operation`.

- In the code above we evaluate the result immediately for brevity, but the power of `Result` is that `it’s value you can pass around elsewhere in your code to deal with at a later time`.

 
## How to control the priority of a task

- Swift tasks can have a priority attached to them, such as `.high` or `.background`, but the priority can also be `nil` if no specific priority was assigned.

- This priority can be used by the system to determine which task should be executed next, but this isn’t guaranteed – think of it as a suggestion rather than a rule.

- Creating a task with a priority look like this:

```swift
func fetchQuotes() async {

    let downloadTask = Task(priority: .high) { () -> String in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/chapter.txt")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
    }

    do {
        let text = try await downloadTask.value
        print(text)
    } catch {
        print(error.localizedDescription)
    }
}

await fetchQuotes()
```

- You can directly assign a priority to a task when it’s created, if you don’t then Swift will follow three rules for deciding the priority automatically:

1- If the task was created from another task, the child task will inherit the priority of the parent task.

2- If the new task was created directly from the main thread as opposed to a task, it’s automatically assigned the highest priority of `.userInitiated`.

3- If the new task wasn’t made by another task or the main thread, Swift will try to query the priority of the thread or give it a `nil` priority.

- `This means not specifying an exact priority is often a good idea because Swift will do The Right Thing.`

- However, like I said you can also specify an exact priority from one of the following:

- The highest priority is `.high`, which is synonymous with `.userInitiated`. As the name implies, this should be used only for tasks that the user specifically started and is actively waiting for.

- Next highest is `medium`, and again as the name implies this is a great choice for most of your tasks that the user isn’t actively waiting for.

- Next is `.low`, which is synonymous with `.utility`. This is the best choice for anything long enough to require a progress bar to be displayed, such as copying files or importing data.

- The lowest priority is `.background`, which is for any work the user can’t see, such as building a search index. This could in theory take hours to complete.

- Like I said, priority inheritance helps get us a sensible priority by default, particularly when creating tasks in response to a user interface action.

- For example, we could build a simple SwiftUI app using a single task, and we don’t need to provide a specific priority –it will automatically run as high priority because it was started from our UI:

```swift
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var jokeText = ""

    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text(jokeText)
            Button("Fetch new joke", action: fetchJoke)
        }
    }

    func fetchJoke() {
        Task {
            let url = URL(string: "https://icanhazdadjoke.com")!
            var request = URLRequest(url: url)
            request.setValue("Swift Concurrency by Example", forHTTPHeaderField: "User-Agent")
            request.setValue("text/plain", forHTTPHeaderField: "Accept")

            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(for: request)

            if let jokeString = String(data: data, encoding: .utf8) {
                jokeText = jokeString
            } else {
                jokeText = "Load failed."
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- Any task can query its current priority using `Task.currentPriority`, but this works from anywhere – if it’s called in a function that is not currently part of a task, Swift will query the system for an answer or send back `.medium`.


## Understanding how priority escalation works

- Every `task` can be `created with a specific priority level`, or `it can inherit a priority from somewhere else`.

- But in two specific circumstances, `Swift will raise the priority of a task` so it’s able to complete faster.

- This always happens because of some specific action from us:

1- If higher-priority task A starts waiting for the result of lower-priority task B, task B will have its priority elevated to the same priority as task A.

2- If lower-priority task A has started running on an actor, and higher-priority task B has been enqueued on that same actor, task A will have its priority elevated to match task B.

- In both cases, Swift is trying to ensure the higher priority task gets the quality of service it needs to run quickly.

- If something very important can only complete when something less important is also complete, then the less important task becomes very important.

- For the most part, this isn’t something we need to worry about in our code – think of it as a bonus feature provided automatically by Swift’s tasks.

- However, there is one place where priority escalation might surprise you, and it’s worth at least being aware of it:

- In our first situation, where a high-priority task uses `await` on a low-priority task, using `Task.currentPriority` will report the `escalated priority` rather than the original priority. 

- So, you might create a task with a low priority, but when you query it a minute later it might have moved up to be a high priority.

- The other situation – if you queue a high-priority task on the same actor where a low-priority task is already running – will also involve priority escalation, but won’t change the value of `.currentPriority`.

- This means your task will run a little faster and it might not be obvious why, but honestly it’s unlikely you’ll even notice this.


## How to cancel a Task

- Swift’s tasks use `cooperative cancellation`, which means that although we can tell a task to stop work, the task itself is free to completely ignore that instruction and carry on for as long as it wants.

- This is a feature rather than a bug: if cancelling a task made it stop work immediately, the task might leave your program in an inconsistent state.

- There are seven things to know when working with task cancellation:

1- You can explicitly cancel a task by calling its `cancel()` method.

2- Any task can check `Task.isCancelled` to determine whether the task has been cancelled or not.

3- You can call the `Task.checkCancellation()` method, which will throw a `CancellationError` if the task has been cancelled or do nothing otherwise.

4- Some parts of Foundation automatically check for task cancellation and will throw their own cancellation error even without your input.

5- If you’re using `Task.sleep()` to wait for some amount of time to pass, that will not honor cancellation requests – the task will still sleep even when cancelled.

6- If the task is part of a group and any part of the group throws an error, the other tasks will be cancelled and awaited.

7- If you have started a task using SwiftUI’s `task()` modifier, that task will automatically be canceled when the view disappears.

- We can explore a few of these in code. First, here’s a function that uses a task to fetch some data from a URL, decodes it into an array, then returns the average:

```swift
func getAverageTemperature() async {

    let fetchTask = Task { () -> Double in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/readings.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        let readings = try JSONDecoder().decode([Double].self, from: data)
        let sum = readings.reduce(0, +)
        return sum / Double(readings.count)
    }

    do {
        let result = try await fetchTask.value
        print("Average temperature: \(result)")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to get data.")
    }
}

await getAverageTemperature()
```

- Now, there is no explicit cancellation in there, but there is implicit cancellation because the `URLSession.shared.data(from:)` call will check to see whether its task is still active before continuing.

- If the task has been cancelled, `data(from:)` will automatically throw a `URLError` and the rest of the task won’t execute.

- However, that implicit check happens before the network call, so it’s unlikely to be an actual cancellation point in practice.

- As most of our users are likely to be using mobile network connections, the network call is likely to take most of the time of this task, particularly if the user has a poor connection.

- So, we could upgrade our task to explicitly check for cancellation after the network request, using `Task.checkCancellation()`.

- This is a static function call because it will always apply to whatever task it’s called inside, and it needs to be called using `try` so that it can throw a `CancellationError` if the task has been cancelled. 

- Here’s the new function:

```swift
func getAverageTemperature() async {

    let fetchTask = Task { () -> Double in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/readings.json")!
        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        
        try Task.checkCancellation()
        
        let readings = try JSONDecoder().decode([Double].self, from: data)
        let sum = readings.reduce(0, +)
        return sum / Double(readings.count)
    }

    do {
        let result = try await fetchTask.value
        print("Average temperature: \(result)")
    } catch {
        print("Failed to get data.")
    }
}

await getAverageTemperature()
```

- As you can see, it just takes one call to `Task.checkCancellation()` to make sure our task isn’t wasting time calculating data that’s no longer needed.

- If you want to handle cancellation yourself – if you need to clean up some resources or perform some other calculations, for example – then instead of calling `Task.checkCancellation()` you should check the value of `Task.isCancelled` instead.

- This is a simple Boolean that returns the current cancellation state, which you can then act on however you want.

- To demonstrate this, we could rewrite our function a third time so that cancelling the task or failing to fetch data returns an average temperature of 0. 

- This time we’re going to cancel the task ourselves as soon as it’s created, but because we’re always returning a default value we no longer need to handle errors when reading the task’s result:

```swift
func getAverageTemperature() async {

    let fetchTask = Task { () -> Double in
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/readings.json")!

        do {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            
            if Task.isCancelled { return 0 }

            let readings = try JSONDecoder().decode([Double].self, from: data)
            let sum = readings.reduce(0, +)
            return sum / Double(readings.count)
        } catch {
            return 0
        }
    }

    fetchTask.cancel()

    let result = await fetchTask.value
    print("Average temperature: \(result)")
}

await getAverageTemperature()
```

- Now we have one `implicit cancellation point` with the `data(from:)` call, and an `explicit one` with the check on `Task.isCancelled`. 

- If either one is triggered, the task will return 0 rather than throw an error.

- Tip: You can use both `Task.checkCancellation()` and `Task.isCancelled` from both synchronous and asynchronous functions.

- Remember, `async functions can call synchronous functions freely`, so checking for cancellation can be just as important to avoid doing unnecessary work.


## How to make a task sleep

- Swift’s `Task` struct has a static `sleep()` method that will cause the current task to be suspended for at least some number of nanoseconds.

- Yes, nanoseconds: you need to write `1_000_000_000 to get 1 second`.

- You need to call `Task.sleep()` using `await` as it will cause the task to be suspended, and you also need to use `try` because `sleep()` will throw an error if the task is cancelled.

- For example, this will make the current task sleep for at least 3 seconds:

```swift
try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 3_000_000_000)
```

- `Important:` Calling `Task.sleep()` will make the current task `sleep for at least the amount of time` you ask, `not exactly the time you ask`.

- There is a little drift involved because the system might be busy doing other work when the sleep ends, but you are at least guaranteed it won’t end before your time has elapsed.

- Using nanoseconds is a bit clumsy, but Swift doesn’t have an alternative at this time – the plan seems to be to wait for a more thorough review of managing time in the language before committing to specific API.

- In the meantime, we can add small `Task extensions` to make sleeping easier to accomplish. 

- For example, this lets us sleep using seconds as a floating-point number:

```swift
extension Task where Success == Never, Failure == Never {
    static func sleep(seconds: Double) async throws {
        let duration = UInt64(seconds * 1_000_000_000)
        try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: duration)
    }
}
```

- With that in place, you can now write `Task.sleep(seconds: 0.5)` or similar.

- Calling `Task.sleep()` automatically checks for cancellation, meaning that if you cancel a sleeping task it will be woken and throw a `CancellationError` for you to catch.

- `Tip:` Unlike making a thread sleep, `Task.sleep()` does not block the underlying thread, allowing it pick up work from elsewhere if needed.


## How to voluntarily suspend a task

- If you’re `executing a long-running task` that has few if any suspension points, for example `if you’re repeatedly iterating over an intensive loop`, you can `call Task.yield()` to voluntarily `suspend the current task so that Swift can give other tasks the chance to proceed a little if needed`.

- To demonstrate this, we could write a simple function to calculate the factors for a number – numbers that divide another number equally.

- For example, the factors for 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. A simple version of this function might look like this:

```swift
func factors(for number: Int) async -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()

    for check in 1...number {
        if number.isMultiple(of: check) {
            result.append(check)
        }
    }

    return result
}

let factors = await factors(for: 120)
print("Found \(factors.count) factors for 120.")
```

- Despite being a pretty inefficient implementation, in release builds that will still execute quite fast even for numbers such as 100,000,000. 

- But if you try something even bigger you’ll notice it struggles – running hundreds of millions of checks is really going to make the task chew up a lot of CPU time, which might mean other tasks are left sitting around unable to make even the slightest progress forward.

- Keep in mind our other tasks might be able to kick off some work then suspend immediately, such as making network requests.

- A `simple improvement` is to `force our factors() method to pause every so often` so that Swift can run other tasks if it wants – we’re effectively asking it to come up for air and let another task have a go.

- So, we could modify the function so that it calls `Task.yield()` every `100,000` numbers, like this:

```swift
func factors(for number: Int) async -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()

    for check in 1...number {
        if check.isMultiple(of: 100_000) {
            await Task.yield()
        }

        if number.isMultiple(of: check) {
            result.append(check)
        }
    }

    return result
}

let factors = await factors(for: 120)
print("Found \(factors.count) factors for 120.")
```

- However, that has the downside of now having twice as much work in the loop. 

- As an alternative, you could `try yielding only when a multiple is actually found`, like this:

```swift
func factors(for number: Int) async -> [Int] {
    var result = [Int]()

    for check in 1...number {   
        if number.isMultiple(of: check) {
            result.append(check)
            await Task.yield()                
        }
    }

    return result
}

let factors = await factors(for: 120)
print("Found \(factors.count) factors for 120.")
```

- That offers Swift the chance to pause every time a multiple is found. 

- Yes, it will be called a lot in the first few iterations, but fewer multiples will be found over time and so it probably won’t yield as often as the previous example – it could well defeat the point of using `yield()` in the first place.

- Calling `yield()` does not always mean the task will stop running: if it has a higher priority than other tasks that are waiting, it’s entirely possible your task will just immediately resume its work.

- Think of this as `guidance` – `we’re giving Swift the chance to execute other tasks temporarily rather than forcing it to do so`.

- Think of calling `Task.yield()` as the equivalent of calling a fictional `Task.doNothing()` method – `it gives Swift the chance to adjust the execution of its tasks without actually creating any real work`.


## How to create a task group and add tasks to it

- Swift’s task groups are collections of tasks that work together to produce a single result.

- Each `task` inside the `group` must `return the same kind of data`, but `if you use enum associated values you can make them send back different kinds of data` – it’s a little clumsy, but it works.

- Creating a `task group` is done in a very precise way to avoid us creating problems for ourselves: rather than creating a `TaskGroup` instance directly, we do so by calling the `withTaskGroup(of:)` function and telling it the data type the task group will return.

- We give this function the code for our group to execute, and Swift will pass in the `TaskGroup` that was created, which we can then use to add tasks to the group.

- First, I want to look at the simplest possible example of task groups, which is returning 5 constant strings, adding them into a single array, then joining that array into a string:

```swift
func printMessage() async {
    let string = await withTaskGroup(of: String.self) { group -> String in
        group.addTask { "Hello" }
        group.addTask { "From" }
        group.addTask { "A" }
        group.addTask { "Task" }
        group.addTask { "Group" }

        var collected = [String]()

        for await value in group {
            collected.append(value)
        }

        return collected.joined(separator: " ")
    }

    print(string)
}

await printMessage()
```

- I know it’s trivial, but it demonstrates several important things:

1- We must specify the exact type of data our task group will return, which in our case is `String.self` so that each child task can return a string.

2- We need to specify exactly what the return value of the group will be using `group -> String` in – Swift finds it hard to figure out the return value otherwise.

3- We call `addTask()` once for each task we want to add to the group, passing in the work we want that task to do.

4- Task groups conform to `AsyncSequence`, so we can read all the values from their children using `for await`, or by calling `group.next()` repeatedly.

5- Because the whole `task group` executes asynchronously, we must call it using `await`.

- However, there’s one other thing you can’t see in that code sample, which is that our `task results are sent back in completion order` and `not creation order`.

- That is, our code above might send back `“Hello From A Task Group”`, but it also might send back `“Task From A Hello Group”`, `“Group Task A Hello From”`, or any other possible variation – the return value could be different every time.

- Tasks created using `withTaskGroup()` cannot throw errors. 

- If you want them to be able to throw errors that bubble upwards – i.e., that are handled outside the task group – you should use `withThrowingTaskGroup()` instead.

- To demonstrate this, and also to demonstrate a more real-world example of `TaskGroup` in action, we could write some code that fetches several news feeds and combines them into one list:

```swift
struct NewsStory: Identifiable, Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let strap: String
    let url: URL
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var stories = [NewsStory]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(stories) { story in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(story.title)
                        .font(.headline)

                    Text(story.strap)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Latest News")
        }
        .task {
            await loadStories()
        }
    }
    
    func loadStories() async {
        do {
            stories = try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: [NewsStory].self) { group -> [NewsStory] in
                for i in 1...5 {
                    group.addTask {
                        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/news-\(i).json")!
                        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
                        return try JSONDecoder().decode([NewsStory].self, from: data)
                    }
                }

                let allStories = try await group.reduce(into: [NewsStory]()) { $0 += $1 }
                return allStories.sorted { $0.id > $1.id }
            }
        } catch {
            print("Failed to load stories")
        }
    }
}
```

- In that code you can see we have a simple struct that contains one news story, a SwiftUI view showing all the news stories we fetched, plus a `loadStories()` method that handles fetching and decoding several news feeds into a single array.

- There are four things in there that deserve special attention:

1- Fetching and decoding news items might throw errors, and those errors are not handled inside the tasks, so we need to use `withThrowingTaskGroup()` to create the group.

2- One of the main advantages of `task groups` is being able to add tasks inside a loop – we can loop from 1 through 5 and call `addTask()` repeatedly.

3- Because the task group conforms to `AsyncSequence`, we can call its `reduce()` method to boil all its task results down to a single value, which in this case is a single array of news stories.

4- As I said earlier, `tasks in a group can complete in any order`, so we sorted the resulting array of news stories to get them all in a sensible order.


- Regardless of whether you’re using throwing or non-throwing tasks, all tasks in a group must complete before the group returns. You have three options here:

1- Awaiting all individual tasks in the group.

2- Calling `waitForAll()` will automatically wait for tasks you have not explicitly awaited, discarding any results they return.

3- If you `do not explicitly await any child tasks, they will be implicitly awaited` – Swift will wait for them anyway, even if you aren’t using their return values.

- Of the three, I find myself using the first most often because it’s the most explicit – you aren’t leaving folks wondering why some or all of your tasks are launched then ignored.


## How to cancel a task group

- Swift’s task groups can be cancelled in one of three ways:

1- If the parent task of the task group is cancelled.

2- If you explicitly call `cancelAll()` on the group.

3- If one of your child tasks throws an uncaught error, all remaining tasks will be implicitly cancelled.

- The first of those happens outside of the task group, but the other two are worth investigating.

- First, calling `cancelAll()` will cancel all remaining tasks.

- As with standalone tasks, `cancelling a task group is cooperative`: your child tasks can check for cancellation using `Task.isCancelled` or `Task.checkCancellation()`, but they can ignore cancellation entirely if they want.

- We could write a simple `printMessage()` function like this one, `creating three tasks inside a group in order to generate a string`:

```swift
func printMessage() async {

    let result = await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: String.self) { group -> String in
        group.addTask {
            return "Testing"
        }

        group.addTask {
            return "Group"
        }

        group.addTask {
            return "Cancellation"
        }

        group.cancelAll()
        var collected = [String]()

        do {
            for try await value in group {
                collected.append(value)
            }
        } catch {
            print(error.localizedDescription)
        }

        return collected.joined(separator: " ")
    }

    print(result)
}

await printMessage()
```

- As you can see, that calls `cancelAll()` immediately after creating all three tasks, and yet when the code is run you’ll still see all three strings printed out.

- I’ve said it before, but it bears repeating and this time in bold: `cancelling a task group is cooperative, so unless the tasks you add implicitly or explicitly check for cancellation calling cancelAll() by itself won’t do much`.

- To see `cancelAll()` actually working, try replacing the first `addTask()` call with this:

```swift
group.addTask {
    try Task.checkCancellation()
    return "Testing"
}
```

- And now our behavior will be different: you might see “Cancellation” by itself, “Group” by itself, “Cancellation Group”, “Group Cancellation”, or nothing at all.

- To understand why, keep the following in mind:

1- Swift will start all three tasks immediately. They might all run in parallel; it depends on what the system thinks will work best at runtime.

2- Although we immediately call `cancelAll()`, some of the tasks might have started running.

3- All the tasks finish in completion order, so when we first loop over the group we might receive the result from any of the three tasks.

- When you put those together, it’s entirely possible the first task to complete is the one that calls `Task.checkCancellation()`, which means our loop will exit, we’ll print an error message, and send back an empty string.

- Alternatively, one or both of the other tasks might run first, in which case we’ll get our other possible outputs.

- Remember, calling `cancelAll()` only cancels remaining tasks, `meaning that it won’t undo work that has already completed`.

- Even then the `cancellation is cooperative`, so you need to `make sure the tasks you add to the group check for cancellation`.

- This code attempts to fetch, merge, and display using SwiftUI the contents of five news feeds. 
- If any of the fetches throws an error the whole group will throw an error and end, but if a fetch somehow succeeds while ending up with an empty array it means our data quota has run out and we should stop trying any other feed fetches.

- Here’s the code:

```swift
struct NewsStory: Identifiable, Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let title: String
    let strap: String
    let url: URL
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var stories = [NewsStory]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(stories) { story in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(story.title)
                        .font(.headline)

                    Text(story.strap)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Latest News")
        }
        .task {
            await loadStories()
        }
    }
    
    func loadStories() async {
        do {
            try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: [NewsStory].self) { group -> Void in
                for i in 1...5 {
                    group.addTask {
                        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/news-\(i).json")!
                        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
                        try Task.checkCancellation()
                        return try JSONDecoder().decode([NewsStory].self, from: data)
                    }
                }

                for try await result in group {
                    if result.isEmpty {
                        group.cancelAll()
                    } else {
                        stories.append(contentsOf: result)
                    }
                }

                stories.sort { $0.id < $1.id }
            }
        } catch {
            print("Failed to load stories: \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
    }
}
```

- As you can see, that calls `cancelAll()` as soon as any feed sends back an empty array, thus aborting all remaining fetches. 
- Inside the child tasks there is an explicit call to `Task.checkCancellation()`, but the `data(from:)` also runs check for cancellation to avoid doing unnecessary work.

- The other way task groups get cancelled is if one of the tasks throws an uncaught error.

- We can write a simple test for this by creating two tasks inside a group, both of which sleep for a little time.

- The `first task will sleep for 1 second then throw an example error`, whereas the `second will sleep for 2 seconds then print the value of Task.isCancelled`.

```swift
enum ExampleError: Error {
    case badURL
}

func testCancellation() async {
    do {
        try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.self) { group -> Void in
            group.addTask {
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000_000)
                throw ExampleError.badURL
            }

            group.addTask {
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 2_000_000_000)
                print("Task is cancelled: \(Task.isCancelled)")
            }

            try await group.next()
        }
    } catch {
        print("Error thrown: \(error.localizedDescription)")
    }
}

await testCancellation()
```

- Note: Just throwing an error inside `addTask()` isn’t enough to `cause other tasks in the group to be cancelled` – this only happens when you access the value of the throwing task using `next()` or when looping over the child tasks.

- This is why the code sample above specifically waits for the result of a task, because doing so will cause `ExampleError.badURL` to `be rethrown and cancel the other task`.

- Calling `addTask()` on your group will unconditionally add a new task to the group, even if you have already cancelled the group. 

- If you want to avoid adding tasks to a cancelled group, use the `addTaskUnlessCancelled()` method instead – it works identically except `will do nothing if called on a cancelled group`. 

- Calling `addTaskUnlessCancelled()` returns a Boolean that will be true if the task was successfully added, or false if the task group was already cancelled.


## How to handle different result types in a task group

- Each task in a Swift `task group must return the same type of data as all the other tasks in the group`, which is often problematic – what if you need one task group to handle several different types of data?

- In this situation you should consider using `async let` for your concurrency if you can, because every `async let` expression `can return its own unique data type`.

- So, the first might result in an array of strings, the second in an integer, and so on, and once you’ve awaited them all you can use them however you please.

- However, if you need to use task groups – for example if you need to create your tasks in a loop – then there is a solution: 

- `Create an enum with associated values that wrap the underlying data you want to return`.

- Using this approach, `each of the tasks in your group still return a single data type` – `one of the cases from your enum` – but `inside those cases you can place the unique data types you’re actually using`.

- This is best demonstrated with some example code, but because it’s quite a lot I’m going to add inline comments so you can see what’s going on:

```swift
// A struct we can decode from JSON, storing one message from a contact.
struct Message: Decodable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let message: String
}

// A user, containing their name, favorites list, and messages array.
struct User {
    let username: String
    let favorites: Set<Int>
    let messages: [Message]
}

// A single enum we'll be using for our tasks, each containing a different associated value.
enum FetchResult {
    case username(String)
    case favorites(Set<Int>)
    case messages([Message])
}

func loadUser() async {
    // Each of our tasks will return one FetchResult, and the whole group will send back a User.
    let user = await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: FetchResult.self) { group -> User in
        // Fetch our username string
        group.addTask {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/username.json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            let result = String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)

            // Send back FetchResult.username, placing the string inside.
            return .username(result)
        }
        
        // Fetch our favorites set
        group.addTask {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-favorites.json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            let result = try JSONDecoder().decode(Set<Int>.self, from: data)

            // Send back FetchResult.favorites, placing the set inside.
            return .favorites(result)
        }

        // Fetch our messages array
        group.addTask {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/user-messages.json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            let result = try JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data)

            // Send back FetchResult.messages, placing the message array inside
            return .messages(result)
        }
        
        // At this point we've started all our tasks,
        // so now we need to stitch them together into
        // a single User instance. First, we set
        // up some default values:
        var username = "Anonymous"
        var favorites = Set<Int>()
        var messages = [Message]()

        // Now we read out each value, figure out 
        // which case it represents, and copy its
        // associated value into the right variable.
        do {
            for try await value in group {
                switch value {
                case .username(let value):
                    username = value
                case .favorites(let value):
                    favorites = value
                case .messages(let value):
                    messages = value
                }
            }
        } catch {
            // If any of the fetches went wrong, we might
            // at least have partial data we can send back.
            print("Fetch at least partially failed; sending back what we have so far. \(error.localizedDescription)")
        }
        
        // Send back our user, either filled with
        // default values or using the data we
        // fetched from the server.
        return User(username: username, favorites: favorites, messages: messages)
    }

    // Now do something with the finished user data.
    print("User \(user.username) has \(user.messages.count) messages and \(user.favorites.count) favorites.")
}

await loadUser()
```

- I know it’s a lot of code, but really it boils down to two things:

1- `Creating an enum with one case for each type of data you’re expecting`, with `each case having an associated value of that type`.

2- `Reading the results from your group’s tasks using a switch block that reads each case from your enum, extracts the associated value inside, and acts on it appropriately`.

- So, it’s not impossible to handle heterogeneous results in a task group, it just requires a little extra thinking.


## What is the difference between async let tasks and task groups?

- Swift `async let`, `Task`, and `task groups` all solve a similar problem: 

- They allow us to create concurrency in our code so the system is able to run them efficiently. 

- Beyond that, the way they work is quite different, and which you’ll choose depends on your exact scenario.

- To help you understand how they differ, and provide some guidance on where each one is a good idea, I want to walk through the key behaviors of each of them.

- First, `async let` and `Task` are designed to `create specific, individual pieces of work`, whereas `task groups` are designed to `run multiple pieces of work at the same time and gather the results`.

- As a result, `async let` and `Task` have `no way to express a dynamic amount of work that should run in parallel`.

- For example, if you had an array of URLs and wanted to fetch them all in parallel, convert them into arrays of weather readings, then average them to a single Double, `task groups` would be a great choice because you won’t know ahead of time how many URLs are in your array.

- Trying to write this using `async let` or `Task` just wouldn’t work, because you’d have to `hard-code the exact number of async let lines rather than just loop over an array`.

- Second, `task groups` automatically let us process results from child tasks in the order they complete, rather than in an order we specify.

- For example, if we wanted to fetch five pieces of data, `task groups` allow us to use `group.next()` to read whichever of the five comes back first, whereas using `async let` and `Task` would require us to await values in a specific, fixed order.

- That alone is a helpful feature of task groups, but in some situations it goes from helpful to crucial.

- For example, if you have three possible servers for some data and want to use whichever one responds fastest, `task groups` are perfect – you can use `addTask()` once for each server, then call `next()` only once to read whichever one responded fastest.

- Third, although all three forms of concurrency will automatically be marked as cancelled if their parent task is cancelled, only `Task` and `task group` can be cancelled directly, using `cancel()` and `cancelAll()` respectively. There is no equivalent for `async let`.

- Fourth, because `async let` doesn’t give us a handle to the underlying task it creates for us, it’s not possible to pass that task elsewhere – we can’t start an `async let` task in one function then pass that task to a different function.

- On the other hand, if you create a task that returns a string and never throws an error, you can pass that `Task<String, Never>` object around as needed.

- And finally, although `task groups` can work with heterogeneous results – i.e., child tasks that return different types of data – it takes the extra work of making an enum to wrap the data. 

- `async let` and `Task` do not suffer from this problem because they always return a single result type, so each result can be different.

- By sheer volume of advantages you might think that `async let` is clearly much less useful than both `Task` and `task groups`, but not all those points carry equal weight in real-world code. 

- In practice, I would suggest you’re likely to:

1- Use `async let` the most, it `works best when there is a fixed amount of work to do`.

2- Use `Task` for some places where `async let` doesn’t work, such as `passing an incomplete value to a function`.

3- Use `task groups` least commonly, or at least use them directly least commonly – you might build other things on top of them.


- I find that order is pretty accurate in practice, for a number of reasons:

1- I normally want results from all the work I start, so being able to skip some or get results in completion order is less important.

2- It’s surprisingly common to want to work with different data types, which is clumsy with `task groups`.

3- If I need to be able to cancel tasks, `Task` is similar enough to `async let` that it’s easy to move across to `Task` without going all the way to a `task group`.

- I would recommend you start with `async let`, move to `Task` if needed, then go to `task groups` only if there’s something specific they offer that you need.


## How to make async command-line tools and scripts

- If you’re writing a command-line tool, you can use `async` in conjunction with the `@main` attribute to launch your app into an async context immediately. 

- To do this, first create the static `main()` method as you normally would with `@main`, then add `async` to it.

- You can optionally also add `throws` if you don’t intend to handle errors there.

- For example, we could write a small command-line tool that fetches data from a URL and prints it out:

```swift
@main
struct UserFetcher {
    static func main() async throws {
        let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/users.csv")!

        for try await line in url.lines {
            print("Received user: \(line)")
        }
    }
}
```

- `Tip:` Just like using the `@main` attribute with a synchronous `main()` method, you should not include a `main.swift` file in your command-line project.

- Using `async` and `@main` together benefits from the full range of Swift concurrency features. 

- Behind the scenes, Swift will automatically create a new task in which it runs your `main()` method, then terminate the program when that task finishes.

- Although it doesn’t work in the current Xcode release, the `goal is for Swift to support async calls in top-level code`. 

- This would mean you could use `main.swift` files and remove most of the code in the previous sample – you could just go ahead and make async calls outside of a function.


## How to create and use task local values

- Swift lets us attach metadata to a task using task-local values, which are small pieces of information that any code inside a task can read.

- We already seen how we can read `Task.isCancelled` to see whether the current task is cancelled or not, but that’s not a true static property – `it’s scoped to the current task, rather than shared across all tasks`.

- This is the power of task-local values: `the ability to create static-like properties inside a task`.

- `Important`: Most people will not want to use task-local values – if you’re just curious you’re welcome to read on and explore how task-local values work, but honestly they are useful in only a handful of very specific circumstances and if you find them complex I wouldn’t worry too much.

- Task-local values are analogous to thread-local values in an old-style multithreading environment: `we attach some metadata to our task, and any code running inside that task can read that data as needed`.

- Swift’s implementation is carefully scoped so that you create contexts where the data is available, rather than just injecting it directly into the task, which makes it possible to adjust your metadata over time.

- However, `inside that context all code is able to read your task-local values`, regardless of how it’s used.

- Using task-local values happens in four steps:

1- Creating a type that has one or more properties we want to make into task-local values. This can be an enum, struct, class, or even actor if you want, but I’d suggest starting with an enum so it’s clear you don’t intend to make instances of the type.

2- Marking each of your task-local values with the `@TaskLocal` property wrapper. These properties can be any type you want, including optionals, but must be marked as `static`.

3- Starting a new task-local scope using `YourType.$yourProperty.withValue(someValue) { … }`.

4- Inside the task-local scope, any time you read `YourType.yourProperty` you will receive the task-local value for that property – it’s not a regular static property that has a single value shared between all parts of your program, but instead it can return a different value depending on which task tries to read it.

- First, our simple example. This will create a `User` enum with a `id` property that is marked `@TaskLocal`, then it will launch a couple of tasks with different values for that user ID. 

- Each task will do exactly the same thing: `print the user ID, sleep for a small amount of time, then print the user ID again`, which `will allow you to see both tasks running at the same time while having their own unique task-local user ID`.

```swift
enum User {
    @TaskLocal static var id = "Anonymous"
}

@main
struct App {
    static func main() async throws {
        Task {
            try await User.$id.withValue("Piper") {
                print("Start of task: \(User.id)")
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
                print("End of task: \(User.id)")
            }
        }

        Task {
            try await User.$id.withValue("Alex") {
                print("Start of task: \(User.id)")
                try await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: 1_000_000)
                print("End of task: \(User.id)")
            }
        }

        print("Outside of tasks: \(User.id)")
    }
}
```

```
When that code runs it will print:

Start of task: Alex
Start of task: Piper
Outside of tasks: Anonymous
End of task: Alex
End of task: Piper
```

- Of course, because the two tasks run independently of each other you might also find that the order of Piper and Alex switch. 

- The important thing is that each task has its own value for `User.id` even as they overlap, and code outside the task will continue to use the original value.

- As you can see, Swift makes it impossible to forget about a task-local value you’ve set, because it only exists for the work inside `withValue()`.

- This scoping approach also means it’s possible to nest multiple task locals as needed, and you can even shadow task locals – start a scope for one, do some work, then start another nested scope for that same property. so that it temporarily has a different value.

- In real-world code, task-local values are useful for places where you need to repeatedly pass values around inside your tasks – values that need to be shared within the task, but not across your whole program like a singleton might be. 


- As a more complex example, we could create a simple `Logger` struct that writes out messages depending on the current level of logging: `debug` being the lowest log level, then `info`, `warn`, `error`, and finally `fatal` at the highest level. 

- If we make the log level – which messages to print – be a task-local value, then each of our tasks can have whatever level of logging they want, regardless of what other tasks are doing.

- To make this work we need three things:

1- An enum to describe the five levels of logging.

2- A `Logger` struct that is a singleton.

3- A `task-local` property inside `Logger` to store the current log level. `(Even though the logger is a singleton, the log level is task-local.)`

- On top of that, we need a couple more things to actually demonstrate the logger in action: a `fetch()` method that downloads data from a URL and creates various logging messages, and a couple of tasks that call `fetch()` with different task-local log settings so we can see exactly how it all works.

```swift
// Our five log levels, marked Comparable so we can use < and > with them.
enum LogLevel: Comparable {
    case debug, info, warn, error, fatal
}

struct Logger {

    // The log level for an individual task
    @TaskLocal static var logLevel = LogLevel.info

    // Make this struct a singleton
    private init() { }
    static let shared = Logger()

    // Print out a message only if it meets or exceeds our log level.
    func write(_ message: String, level: LogLevel) {
        if level >= Logger.logLevel {
            print(message)
        }
    }
}

@main
struct App {

    // Returns data from a URL, writing log messages along the way.
    static func fetch(url urlString: String) async throws -> String? {
        Logger.shared.write("Preparing request: \(urlString)", level: .debug)

        if let url = URL(string: urlString) {
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            Logger.shared.write("Received \(data.count) bytes", level: .info)
            return String(decoding: data, as: UTF8.self)
        } else {
            Logger.shared.write("URL \(urlString) is invalid", level: .error)
            return nil
        }
    }

    // Starts a couple of fire-and-forget tasks with different log levels.
    static func main() async throws {
        Task {
            try await Logger.$logLevel.withValue(.debug) {
                try await fetch(url: "https://hws.dev/news-1.json")
            }
        }

        Task {
            try await Logger.$logLevel.withValue(.error) {
                try await fetch(url: "https:\\hws.dev/news-1.json")
            }
        }
    }
}
```

- When that runs you’ll see `“Preparing request: https://hws.dev/news-1.json”` as the first task starts, then `“URL https:\hws.dev/news-1.json is invalid”` as the second task starts (I used a back slash rather than forward slash), then `“Received 8075 bytes”` as the first task finishes downloading its data.

- So, here our `fetch()` method doesn’t even need to know that a task-local value is being used – it just calls the `Logger` singleton, which in turn refers to the task-local value.

- To finish up, I want to leave you with a few important tips for using task-local values:

1- It’s okay to access a task-local value outside of a `withValue()` scope – `you’ll just get back whatever default value you gave it.` 

2- Although regular tasks inherit task-local values of their parent task, detached tasks do not because they don’t have a parent.

3- Task-local values `are read-only`; you can only modify them by calling `withValue()` as shown above.


- Put more plainly, if task locals are the answer, there’s a very good chance you’re asking the wrong question.


## How to run tasks using SwiftUI task modifier

- SwiftUI provides a `task()` modifier that starts a new detached task as soon as a view appears, and automatically cancels the task when the view disappears.

- This is sort of the equivalent of starting a task in `onAppear()` then cancelling it `onDisappear()`, although `task()` has an extra ability to track an identifier and restart its task when the identifier changes.

- In the simplest scenario – and probably the one you’re going to use the most – `task()` is the best way to load your view’s initial data, which might be loaded from local storage or by fetching and decoding a remote URL.

- For example, this downloads data from a server and decodes it into an array for display in a list:

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let from: String
    let text: String
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var messages = [Message]()

    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List(messages) { message in
                VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                    Text(message.from)
                        .font(.headline)

                    Text(message.text)
                }
            }
            .navigationTitle("Inbox")
            .task {
                await loadMessages()
            }
        }
    }

    func loadMessages() async {
        do {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/messages.json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            messages = try JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data)
        } catch {
            messages = [
                Message(id: 0, from: "Failed to load inbox.", text: "Please try again later.")
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

- Important: The `task()` modifier is a great place to load the data for your SwiftUI views.

- Remember, they can be recreated many times over the lifetime of your app, so you should avoid putting this kind of work into their initializers if possible.

- A more advanced usage of `task()` is to attach some kind of `Equatable` identifying value – when that value changes SwiftUI will automatically cancel the previous task and create a new task with the new value.

- This might be some shared app state, such as whether the user is logged in or not, or some local state, such as what kind of filter to apply to some data.

- As an example, we could upgrade our messaging view to support both an `Inbox` and a `Sent` box, both fetched and decoded using the same `task()` modifier.

- By setting the message box type as the identifier for the task with `.task(id: selectedBox)`, SwiftUI will automatically update its message list every time the selection changes.

- Here’s how that looks in code:

```swift
struct Message: Decodable, Identifiable {
    let id: Int
    let user: String
    let text: String
}

// Our content view is able to handle two kinds of message box now.
struct ContentView: View {
    @State private var messages = [Message]()
    @State private var selectedBox = "Inbox"
    let messageBoxes = ["Inbox", "Sent"]
    
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            List {
                Section {
                    ForEach(messages) { message in
                        VStack(alignment: .leading) {
                            Text(message.user)
                                .font(.headline)

                            Text(message.text)
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            .listStyle(.insetGrouped)
            .navigationTitle(selectedBox)

            // Our task modifier will recreate its fetchData() task whenever selectedBox changes
            .task(id: selectedBox) {
                await fetchData()
            }
            .toolbar {
                // Switch between our two message boxes
                Picker("Select a message box", selection: $selectedBox) {
                    ForEach(messageBoxes, id: \.self, content: Text.init)
                }
                .pickerStyle(.segmented)
            }
        }
    }
    
     // This is almost the same as before, but now loads the selectedBox JSON file rather than always loading the inbox.
    func fetchData() async {
        do {
            let url = URL(string: "https://hws.dev/\(selectedBox.lowercased()).json")!
            let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
            messages = try JSONDecoder().decode([Message].self, from: data)
        } catch {
            messages = [
                Message(id: 0, user: "Failed to load message box.", text: "Please try again later.")
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

- Tip: That example uses the `shared URLSession`, which means it will cache its responses and so load the two inboxes only once.

- If that’s what you want you’re all set, but if you want it to always fetch the files make sure you create your own session configuration and disable caching.

- One particularly interesting use case for `task()` is with `AsyncSequence` collections that continuously generate values.

- This might be a server that maintains an open connection while sending fresh content, it might be the `URLWatcher` example we looked at previously, or perhaps just a local value.

- For example, we could write a simple random number generator that regularly emits new random numbers – with the `task()` modifier we can constantly watch that for changes, and stream the results into a SwiftUI view.

- To bring this example to life, we’re going to add one more thing: the random number generator will print a message every time a number is generated, and the resulting number list will be shown inside a detail view.

- Both of these are done so you can see how `task()` automatically cancels its work: the numbers will automatically start streaming when the detail view is shown, and stop streaming when the view is dismissed.

```swift
// A simple random number generator sequence
struct NumberGenerator: AsyncSequence, AsyncIteratorProtocol {
    typealias Element = Int
    let delay: Double
    let range: ClosedRange<Int>

    init(in range: ClosedRange<Int>, delay: Double = 1) {
        self.range = range
        self.delay = delay
    }

    mutating func next() async -> Int? {
        // Make sure we stop emitting numbers when our task is cancelled
        while Task.isCancelled == false {
            try? await Task.sleep(nanoseconds: UInt64(delay) * 1_000_000_000)
            print("Generating number")
            return Int.random(in: range)
        }

        return nil
    }

    func makeAsyncIterator() -> NumberGenerator {
        self
    }
}

// This exists solely to show DetailView when requested.
struct ContentView: View {
    var body: some View {
        NavigationView {
            NavigationLink(destination: DetailView()) {
                Text("Start Generating Numbers")
            }
        }
    }
}

// This generates and displays all the random numbers we've generated.
struct DetailView: View {
    @State private var numbers = [String]()
    let generator = NumberGenerator(in: 1...100)

    var body: some View {
        List(numbers, id: \.self, rowContent: Text.init)
            .task {
                await generateNumbers()
            }
    }

    func generateNumbers() async {
        for await number in generator {
            numbers.insert("\(numbers.count + 1). \(number)", at: 0)
        }
    }
}
```

- Notice how the `generateNumbers()` method at the end doesn’t actually have any way of exiting? 

- That’s because it will exit automatically when `generator` stops returning values, which will happen when the task is cancelled, and that will happen when `DetailView` is dismissed – it takes no special work from us.

- Tip: The `task()` modifier accepts a `priority` parameter if you want fine-grained control over your task’s priority. 

- For example, use `.task(priority: .low)` to create a low-priority task.


## Is it efficient to create many tasks

- Previously we talked about the concept of `thread explosion`, which is `when you create many more threads than CPU cores and the system struggles to manage them effectively`.

- However, Swift’s `tasks are implemented very differently from threads`, and so are significantly less likely to cause performance problems when used in large numbers. 

- In fact one of the Swift team who worked on it said that unless you’re creating over 10,000 tasks it’s not worth worrying about the impact of so many tasks.

- That doesn’t mean creating so many tasks is necessarily the best idea.

- You might think that’s hard to do, but a task group calling `addTask()` inside a loop might create several hundred or even several thousand depending on what you were looping over.

- And that’s okay. Again, even if you’re creating well over 10,000 tasks it’s not likely to cause a problem as long as you know that’s what you’re doing – if that’s the architectural choice you’re making after evaluating the alternative.

- So, broadly speaking you should feel free to create as many tasks as you want, but if you ever find yourself creating tasks to transform elements inside huge arrays you might want to double-check your performance using something like Instruments.


# Actors


## What is an actor and why does Swift have them?

- Swift’s `actors are conceptually like classes that are safe to use in concurrent environments`.

- This safety is made possible because `Swift automatically ensures no two pieces of code attempt to access an actor’s data at the same time` – it is made impossible by the compiler, rather than requiring developers to write boilerplate code using systems such as locks.

- In the following chapters we’re going to explore more about how actors work and when you should use them, but here is the least you need to know:

1- Actors are created using the `actor` keyword. This `is a concrete nominal type in Swift`, like structs, classes, and enums.

2- Like classes, `actors are reference types`. This `makes them useful for sharing state in your program`.

3- They have many of the same features as classes: you can give them properties, methods (async or otherwise), initializers, and subscripts, they can conform to protocols, and they can be generic.

4- Actors `do not support inheritance`, so they `cannot have convenience initializers`, and do `not support either final or override`.

5- All actors automatically conform to the `Actor` protocol, which `no other type can use`. This allows you to `write code restricted to work only with actors`.

- There is one more behavior of `actors` that lies at the center of their existence: `if you’re attempting to read a variable property or call a method on an actor, and you’re doing it from outside the actor itself, you must do so asynchronously using await`.

```swift
actor User {
    var score = 10

    func printScore() {
        print("My score is \(score)")
    }

    func copyScore(from other: User) async {
        score = await other.score
    }
}

let actor1 = User()
let actor2 = User()

await print(actor1.score)
await actor1.copyScore(from: actor2)
```

- You can see several things in action there:

1- The new `User` type is created using the `actor` keyword.

2- It can have properties and methods just like structs or classes.

3- The `printScore()` method can access the local `score` property just fine, because it’s our actor’s method reading its own property.

4- But in `copyScore(from:)` we’re attempting to read the `score from another user`, and we can’t read their `score` property without marking the request with `await`.

5- Code from outside the `actor` also needs to use `await`.

- The reason the `await` call is needed in `copyScore(from:)` is central to the reasons actors are needed at all.

- You see, `rather than just letting us poke around in an actor’s mutable state`, Swift silently translates that request into what is effectively a message that goes into the actor’s message inbox: “please let me know your score as soon as you can.”

- If the actor is currently idle it can respond with the score straight away and our code continues no different from if we had used a class or a struct.

- But the `actor might also have multiple other messages waiting in its inbox that it needs to deal with first`, so our score request has to `wait`.

- Eventually our request makes it to the top of the inbox and it will be dealt with, and the `copyScore(from:)` method will continue.

- This means several things:

1- `Actors are effectively operating a private serial queue for their message inbox`, taking requests one at a time and fulfilling them. This executes requests in the order they were received, but `you can also use task priority to escalate requests`.

2- Only `one piece of code at a time can access an actor’s mutable state` unless you specifically mark some things as being `unprotected`. Swift calls this `actor isolation`.

3- Just like regular `await` calls, `reading an actor’s property or method marks a potential suspension point` – we might get a value back immediately, but it might also take a little time.

4- Any `state that is not mutable` – i.e., `a constant property` – can be accessed without `await`, because it’s always going to be safe.

-  If you are writing code inside an actor’s method, you can read other properties on that actor and call its synchronous methods without using `await`, but if you’re trying to use that data from outside the actor `await` is required even for synchronous properties and methods.

- Think of situations where using `self` is possible: if you could `self` you don’t need `await`.

- `Writing properties from outside an actor is not allowed, with or without await.`

- If you ever need to make sure that access to some object is restricted to a single task at a time, actors are perfect.

- This is more common than you might think – yes, `UI work should be restricted to the main thread`, but `you probably also want to restrict database access so that you can’t write conflicting data`, for example.

- There are also times when `simultaneous concurrent access to data can cause data races` – when the outcome of your work depends on the order in which tasks complete.

- These errors are particularly nasty to find and fix, but with actors such data races become impossible.

- `Tip`: Creating an instance of `an actor has no extra performance cost` compared to creating an instance of a class; `the only performance difference comes when trying to access the protected state of an actor, which might trigger task suspension`.


## How to create and use an actor in Swift

- Creating and using an `actor` in Swift takes two steps: create the type using `actor`, then use `await` when accessing its properties or methods externally.

- Swift takes care of everything else for us, including ensuring that properties and methods must be accessed safely.

- Let’s look at a simple example: a URL cache that remembers the data for each URL it downloads. 

- Here’s how that would be created and used:

```swift
actor URLCache {
    private var cache = [URL: Data]()

    func data(for url: URL) async throws -> Data {
        if let cached = cache[url] {
            return cached
        }

        let (data, _) = try await URLSession.shared.data(from: url)
        cache[url] = data
        return data
    }
}

@main
struct App {
    static func main() async throws {
        let cache = URLCache()

        let url = URL(string: "https://apple.com")!
        let apple = try await cache.data(for: url)
        let dataString = String(decoding: apple, as: UTF8.self)
        print(dataString)
    }
}
```

- I marked its internal `cache` dictionary as `private`, so the only way we can access cached data is using the `data(for:)` method.

- This provides some degree of safety, because we might do some sort of special work inside the method that would be bypassed by accessing the property directly.

- However, the `real protection here is that the property and method are both encapsulated inside an actor`, which `means only a single thread can use them at any given time`.

- In practice, this avoids two problems:

1- Attempting to read from a dictionary at the same time we’re writing to it, which can cause your app to crash.

2- Two or more simultaneous requests for the same uncached URL coming in, forcing our code to fetch and store the same data repeatedly. This is a data race: whether we make two requests or one depends on the exact way our code is executed.

- However, this ease of use does come with some extra responsibility: 

- It’s really important you keep in mind the `serial queue behavior of actors`, because it’s entirely possible you can create massive speed bumps in your code just because you wrote `actor` rather than `class`.

- Think about the URL cache we just made, for example – just by using `actor` rather than `class` when we made it, `we forced it to load only a single URL at a time`.

-  If that’s what you want then you’re all set, but if not then you’ll be wondering why all its requests are handled one by one.

- The best example of why data races are problematic – the one that is often taught in computer science degrees – is about bank accounts, because here data races can result in serious real-world problems.

- To see why, here’s an example `BankAccount class` that handles sending and receiving money:

```swift
class BankAccount {
    var balance: Decimal

    init(initialBalance: Decimal) {
        balance = initialBalance
    }

    func deposit(amount: Decimal) {
        balance = balance + amount
    }

    func transfer(amount: Decimal, to other: BankAccount) {
        // Check that we have enough money to pay
        guard balance > amount else { return }

        // Subtract it from our balance
        balance = balance - amount

        // Send it to the other account
        other.deposit(amount: amount)
    }
}

let firstAccount = BankAccount(initialBalance: 500)
let secondAccount = BankAccount(initialBalance: 0)
firstAccount.transfer(amount: 500, to: secondAccount)
```

- That’s a `class`, so Swift `won’t do anything to stop us from accessing the same piece of data multiple times`.

- In the worst case two parallel calls to `transfer()` would be called on the same `BankAccount` instance, and the following would occur:

1- The first would check whether the balance was sufficient for the transfer. It is, so the code would continue.

2- The second would also check whether the balance was sufficient for the transfer. It still is, so the code would continue.

3- The first would then subtract the amount from the balance, and deposit it in the other account.

4- The second would then subtract the amount from the balance, and deposit it in the other account.

- Well, what happens if the account we’re transferring from contains $100, and we’re asked to transfer $80 to the other account? 

- If we follow the steps above, both calls to `transfer()` will happen in parallel and see that there was enough for the transfer to take place, then both will transfer the money across.

- The end result is that our check for sufficient funds wasn’t useful, and one account ends up with -$60 – something that might incur fees, or perhaps not even be allowed depending on the type of account they have.

- If we switch this type to be an `actor`, that problem goes away. 

- This means using `actor BankAccount` rather than `class BankAccount`, but also using `async and await` because we can’t directly call `deposit()` on the other bank account and instead need to post the request as a message to be executed later.

```swift
actor BankAccount {
    var balance: Decimal

    init(initialBalance: Decimal) {
        balance = initialBalance
    }

    func deposit(amount: Decimal) {
        balance = balance + amount
    }

    func transfer(amount: Decimal, to other: BankAccount) async {
        // Check that we have enough money to pay
        guard balance > amount else { return }

        // Subtract it from our balance
        balance = balance - amount

        // Send it to the other account
        await other.deposit(amount: amount)
    }
}

let firstAccount = BankAccount(initialBalance: 500)
let secondAccount = BankAccount(initialBalance: 0)
await firstAccount.transfer(amount: 500, to: secondAccount)
```

- With that change, our bank accounts can no longer fall into negative values by accident, which avoids a potentially nasty result.

- In other places, actors can prevent bizarre results that ought to be impossible.

- For example, what would happen if our example was a basketball team rather than a bank account, and we were transferring players rather than money? 

- Without actors we could end up in the situation where we transfer the same player twice – Team A would end up without them, and Team B would have them twice!


## How to make function parameters isolated

- Any `properties and methods that belong to an actor are isolated to that actor`. 

- You can `make external functions isolated to an actor if you want`.

- This `allows the function to access actor-isolated state as if it were inside that actor`, without needing to use `await`.

- Here’s a simple example so you can see what I mean:

```swift
actor DataStore {
    var username = "Anonymous"
    var friends = [String]()
    var highScores = [Int]()
    var favorites = Set<Int>()

    init() {
        // load data here
    }

    func save() {
        // save data here
    }
}

func debugLog(dataStore: isolated DataStore) {
    print("Username: \(dataStore.username)")
    print("Friends: \(dataStore.friends)")
    print("High scores: \(dataStore.highScores)")
    print("Favorites: \(dataStore.favorites)")
}

let data = DataStore()
await debugLog(dataStore: data)
```

- That creates a `DataStore` actor with various properties plus a couple of placeholder methods, then creates a `debugLog()` method that prints those without using `await` – they can be accessed directly.

- Notice the addition of the `isolated` keyword in the function signature, that’s what allows this direct access, and `it even allows the function to write to those properties too`.

- Using `isolated` like this `does not bypass any of the underlying safety or implementation of actors` – there can still only be one thread accessing the actor at any one time.

- What we’ve done `just pushes that access out by a level`, because `now the whole function must be run on that actor rather than just individual lines inside it`.

- In practice, this means `debugLog(dataStore:)` needs to be called using `await`.

- This approach has an important side effect: `because the whole function is now isolated to the actor`, it `must be called using await` even though it isn’t marked as `async`.

- This `makes the function itself a single potential suspension point` rather `than individual accesses to the actor being suspension points`.

- In case you were wondering, `you can’t have two isolation parameters`, because it wouldn’t really make sense – which one is executing the function?


## How to make parts of an actor nonisolated

- All `methods and mutable properties inside an actor are isolated to that actor by default`, which means `they cannot be accessed directly from code that’s external to the actor`.

- `Access to constant properties is automatically allowed` because they are inherently safe from race conditions, but if you want you can make some methods excepted by using the `nonisolated` keyword.

- Actor methods that are non-isolated can access other non-isolated state, such as constant properties or other methods that are marked non-isolated.

- However, `they cannot directly access isolated state like an isolated actor method would`, they need to use `await` instead.

- To demonstrate non-isolated methods, we could write a User actor that has three properties: two constant strings for their username and password, and a variable Boolean to track whether they are online.

- Because `password is constant`, `we could write a non-isolated method that returns the hash of that password using CryptoKit`, like this:

```swift
import CryptoKit
import Foundation

actor User {
    let username: String
    let password: String
    var isOnline = false

    init(username: String, password: String) {
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
    }

    nonisolated func passwordHash() -> String {
        let passwordData = Data(password.utf8)
        let hash = SHA256.hash(data: passwordData)
        return hash.compactMap { String(format: "%02x", $0) }.joined()
    }
}

let user = User(username: "twostraws", password: "s3kr1t")
print(user.passwordHash())
```

- I’d like to pick out a handful of things in that code:

1. Marking `passwordHash()` as `nonisolated` means that we can call it externally without using `await`.

2. We can also use `nonisolated` with computed properties, which in the previous example would have made `nonisolated var passwordHash: String`. Stored properties may not be non-isolated.

3. Non-isolated properties and methods can access only other non-isolated properties and methods, which in our case is a constant property. Swift will not let you ignore this rule.


- Non-isolated methods are particularly useful when dealing with protocol conformances such as `Hashable` and `Codable`, where we must implement methods to be run from outside the actor.

- For example, if we wanted to make our `User actor` conform to `Codable`, we’d need to implement `encode(to:)` ourselves as a non-isolated method like this:

```swift
actor User: Codable {
    enum CodingKeys: CodingKey {
        case username, password
    }

    let username: String
    let password: String
    var isOnline = false

    init(username: String, password: String) {
        self.username = username
        self.password = password
    }

    nonisolated func encode(to encoder: Encoder) throws {
        var container = encoder.container(keyedBy: CodingKeys.self)
        try container.encode(username, forKey: .username)
        try container.encode(password, forKey: .password)
    }
}

let user = User(username: "twostraws", password: "s3kr1t")

if let encoded = try? JSONEncoder().encode(user) {
    let json = String(decoding: encoded, as: UTF8.self)
    print(json)
}
```


## How to use MainActor to run code on the main queue

- `@MainActor` is a global actor that uses the main queue for executing its work.

-  In practice, this means methods or types marked with `@MainActor` can (for the most part) safely modify the UI because it will always be running on the main queue, and calling `MainActor.run()` will push some custom work of your choosing to the main actor, and thus to the main queue.

- At the simplest level both of these features are straightforward to use, but as you’ll see there’s a lot of complexity behind them.

- First, let’s look at using `@MainActor`, which automatically makes a single method or all methods on a type run on the main actor.

- This is particularly useful for any types that exist to update your user interface, such as `ObservableObject` classes.

- For example, we could create a `observable object` with two `@Published` properties, and because they will both update the UI we would mark the whole class with `@MainActor` to ensure these UI updates always happen on the main actor:

```swift
@MainActor
class AccountViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var username = "Anonymous"
    @Published var isAuthenticated = false
}
```

- In fact, this set up is so central to the way `ObservableObject` works that SwiftUI bakes it right in.

- Whenever you use `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject` inside a view, `Swift will ensure that the whole view runs on the main actor` so that you can’t accidentally try to publish UI updates in a dangerous way.

- Even better, no matter what property wrappers you use, the `body` property of your SwiftUI views is always run on the `main actor`.

- Does that mean you don’t need to explicitly add `@MainActor` to observable objects?

- Well, no – there are still benefits to using `@MainActor` with these classes, not least if they are using `async/await` to do their own asynchronous work such as downloading data from a server.

- So, my recommendation is simple: even though SwiftUI ensures main-actor-ness when using `@ObservableObject`, `@StateObject`, and SwiftUI view `body` properties, it’s a good idea to add the `@MainActor` attribute to all your observable object classes to be absolutely sure all UI updates happen on the main actor.

- If you need certain methods or computed properties to opt out of running on the main actor, use `nonisolated` as you would do with a regular actor.

- `Important:` You should `not attempt to use actors for your observable objects`, because `they must do their UI updates on the main actor rather than a custom actor`.

- More broadly, any type that has `@MainActor` objects as properties will also implicitly be `@MainActor` using global actor inference – a set of rules that Swift applies to make sure global-actor-ness works without getting in the way too much.

- The magic of `@MainActor` is that `it automatically forces methods or whole types to run on the main actor`, a lot of the time without any further work from us.

- Previously we needed to do it by hand, remembering to use code like `DispatchQueue.main.async()` or similar every place it was needed, but now the compiler does it for us automatically.

- Be careful: `@MainActor` is really helpful to make code run on the main actor, but it’s not foolproof.

- For example, if you have a `@MainActor` class then in theory all its methods will run on the main actor, but one of those methods could trigger code to run on a background task.

- For example, if you’re using Face ID and call `evaluatePolicy()` to authenticate the user, `the completion handler will be called on a background thread` even though `that code is still within the @MainActor class`.

- If you do need to spontaneously run some code on the main actor, you can do that by calling `MainActor.run()` and providing your work.

- This allows you to safely push work onto the main actor no matter where your code is currently running, like this:

```swift
func couldBeAnywhere() async {
    await MainActor.run {
        print("This is on the main actor.")
    }
}

await couldBeAnywhere()
```

- You can send back nothing from `run()` if you want, or send back a value like this:

```swift
func couldBeAnywhere() async {
    let result = await MainActor.run { () -> Int in
        print("This is on the main actor.")
        return 42
    }

    print(result)
}

await couldBeAnywhere()
```

- Even better, `if that code was already running on the main actor then the code is executed immediately` – `it won’t wait until the next run loop` in the same way that `DispatchQueue.main.async()` would have done.

- If you wanted the work to be sent off to the main actor without waiting for its result to come back, you can place it in a new task like this:

```swift
func couldBeAnywhere() {
    Task {
        await MainActor.run {
            print("This is on the main actor.")
        }
    }

    // more work you want to do
}

couldBeAnywhere()
```

- Or you can also mark your task’s closure as being `@MainActor`, like this:

```swift
func couldBeAnywhere() {
    Task { @MainActor in
        print("This is on the main actor.")
    }

    // more work you want to do
}

couldBeAnywhere()
```

- This is `particularly helpful when you’re inside a synchronous context`, so you need to `push work to the main actor without using the await` keyword.

- `Important:` If `your function is already running on the main actor`, using `await MainActor.run()` will run your code immediately without waiting for the next run loop, but using `Task` as shown above will wait for the next run loop.

- You can see this in action in the following snippet:

```swift
@MainActor class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    func runTest() async {
        print("1")

        await MainActor.run {
            print("2")

            Task { @MainActor in
                print("3")
            }

            print("4")
        }

        print("5")
    }
}
```

- That marks the whole type as using the main actor, so the call to `MainActor.run()` will run immediately when `runTest()` is called.

- However, the inner `Task` will not run immediately, so the code will print `1, 2, 4, 5, 3`.

- Although it’s possible to create your own global actors, I think we should probably avoid doing so until we’ve had sufficient chance to build apps using what we already have.


## Understanding how global actor inference works

- Apple explicitly annotates many of its types as being `@MainActor`, including most `UIKit` types such as `UIView` and `UIButton`.

- However, there are many places where types gain main-actor-ness implicitly through a `process called global actor inference` – Swift applies `@MainActor` automatically based on a set of predetermined rules.

- There are five rules for global actor inference, and I want to tackle them individually because although they start easy they get more complex.

1- First, if a class is marked `@MainActor`, all its subclasses are also automatically `@MainActor`. This follows the principle of least surprise: `if you inherit from a @MainActor class it makes sense that your subclass is also @MainActor`.

2- Second, if a method in a class is marked `@MainActor`, any overrides for that method are also automatically `@MainActor`. Again, this is a natural thing to expect – `you overrode a @MainActor method, so the only safe way Swift can call that override is if it’s also @MainActor`.

3- Third, any struct or class using a property wrapper with `@MainActor` for its wrapped value will automatically be `@MainActor`. This is what makes `@StateObject` and `@ObservedObject` convey main-actor-ness on SwiftUI views that use them – `if you use either of those two property wrappers in a SwiftUI view, the whole view becomes @MainActor` too.

4- If a protocol declares a method as being `@MainActor`, any type that conforms to that protocol will have that same method automatically be `@MainActor` unless you separate the conformance from the method.

- What this means is that if you make a type conform to a protocol with a `@MainActor` method, and add the required method implementation at the same time, it is implicitly `@MainActor`. 

- However, if `you separate the conformance and the method implementation`, you need to add `@MainActor` by hand.

```swift
// A protocol with a single `@MainActor` method.
protocol DataStoring {
    @MainActor func save()
}

// A struct that does not conform to the protocol.
struct DataStore1 { }

// When we make it conform and add save() at the same time, our method is implicitly @MainActor.
extension DataStore1: DataStoring {
    func save() { } // This is automatically @MainActor.
}

// A struct that conforms to the protocol.
struct DataStore2: DataStoring { }

// If we later add the save() method, it will *not* be implicitly @MainActor so we need to mark it as such ourselves.
extension DataStore2 {
    @MainActor func save() { }
}
```

- As you can see, we need to explicitly use `@MainActor func save()` in `DataStore2` because the global actor inference does not apply there. 

- Don’t worry about forgetting it, though – Xcode will automatically check the annotation is there, and offer to add `@MainActor` if it’s missing.

5- If the whole protocol is marked with `@MainActor`, any type that conforms to that protocol will also automatically be `@MainActor` unless you put the conformance separately from the main type declaration, in which case `only the methods are @MainActor`.

```swift
// A protocol marked as @MainActor.
@MainActor protocol DataStoring {
    func save()
}

// A struct that conforms to DataStoring as part of its primary type definition.
struct DataStore1: DataStoring { // This struct is automatically @MainActor.
    func save() { } // This method is automatically @MainActor.
}

// Another struct that conforms to DataStoring as part of its primary type definition.
struct DataStore2: DataStoring { } // This struct is automatically @MainActor.

// The method is provided in an extension, but it's the same as if it were in the primary type definition.
extension DataStore2 {
    func save() { } // This method is automatically @MainActor.
}

// A third struct that does *not* conform to DataStoring in its primary type definition.
struct DataStore3 { } // This struct is not @MainActor.

// The conformance is added as an extension
extension DataStore3: DataStoring {
    func save() { } // This method is automatically @MainActor.
}
```

- If conformance to a `@MainActor` protocol retroactively made the whole of Apple’s type `@MainActor` then you would have dramatically altered the way it worked, probably breaking all sorts of assumptions made elsewhere in the system.

- If it’s your type – a type you’re creating from scratch in your own code – then you can add the protocol conformance as you make the type and therefore isolate the entire type to `@MainActor`, because it’s your choice.


## What is actor hopping and how can it cause problems?

- When `a thread pauses work on one actor to start work on another actor`, we call it `actor hopping`, and it will `happen any time one actor calls another`.

- Behind the scenes, Swift manages a group of threads called the `cooperative thread pool`, `creating as many threads as there are CPU cores so that we can’t be hit by thread explosion`.

- `Actors guarantee that they can be running only one method at a time`, but they `don’t care which thread they are running on` – they will automatically move between threads as needed in order to balance system resources.

- `Actor hopping with the cooperative pool is fast` – it will happen automatically, and we don’t need to worry about it.

- However, the `main thread is not part of the cooperative thread pool`, which means `actor code being run from the main actor will require a context switch`, which will incur a `performance penalty if done too frequently`.

- You can see the problem caused by frequent actor hopping in this toy example code:

```swift
actor NumberGenerator {
    var lastNumber = 1

    func getNext() -> Int {
        defer { lastNumber += 1 }
        return lastNumber
    }

    @MainActor func run() async {
        for _ in 1...100 {
            let nextNumber = await getNext()
            print("Loading \(nextNumber)")
        }
    }
}

let generator = NumberGenerator()
await generator.run()
```

- In that code, the `run()` method must take place on the `main actor` because it has the `@MainActor` attribute attached to it, however the `getNext()` method will run somewhere on the `cooperative pool`, meaning that `Swift will need to perform frequent context switching from to and from the main actor inside the loop`.

- In practice, your code is more likely to look like this:

```swift
// An example piece of data we can show in our UI
struct User: Identifiable {
    let id: Int
}

// An actor that handles serial access to a database
actor Database {
    func loadUser(id: Int) -> User {
        // complex work to load a user from the database
        // happens here; we'll just send back an example
        User(id: id)
    }
}

// An observable object that handles updating our UI
@MainActor
class DataModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var users = [User]()
    var database = Database()

    // Load all our users, updating the UI as each one
    // is successfully fetched
    func loadUsers() async {
        for i in 1...100 {
            let user = await database.loadUser(id: i)
            users.append(user)
        }
    }
}

// A SwiftUI view showing all the users in our data model
struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var model = DataModel()

    var body: some View {
        List(model.users) { user in
            Text("User \(user.id)")
        }
        .task {
            await model.loadUsers()
        }
    }
}
```

- When that runs, the `loadUsers()` method will run on the `main actor`, because the whole `DataModel` class must run there – it has been annotated with `@MainActor` to avoid publishing changes from a background thread.

- However, the database’s `loadUser()` method will `run somewhere on the cooperative pool`: it might run on thread 3 the first time it’s called, thread 5 the second time, thread 8 the third time, and so on; Swift will take care of that for us.

- This means when our code runs it `will repeatedly hop to and from the main actor`, meaning there’s a `significant performance cost introduced by all the context switching`.

- The solution here is to `avoid all the switches by running operations in batches` – hop to the cooperative thread pool once to perform all the actor work required to load many users, then process those batches on the main actor.

- The batch size could potentially load all users at once depending on your need, but even batch sizes of two would halve the context switches compared to individual fetches.

- For example, we could rewrite our previous example like this:

```swift
struct User: Identifiable {
    let id: Int
}

actor Database {
    func loadUsers(ids: [Int]) -> [User] {
        // complex work to load users from the database
        // happens here; we'll just send back examples
        ids.map { User(id: $0) }
    }
}

@MainActor
class DataModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var users = [User]()
    var database = Database()

    func loadUsers() async {
        let ids = Array(1...100)

        // Load all users in one hop
        let newUsers = await database.loadUsers(ids: ids)

        // Now back on the main actor, update the UI
        users.append(contentsOf: newUsers)
    }
}

struct ContentView: View {
    @StateObject var model = DataModel()

    var body: some View {
        List(model.users) { user in
            Text("User \(user.id)")
        }
        .task {
            await model.loadUsers()
        }
    }
}
```

- Notice how the SwiftUI view is identical – we’re just rearranging our internal data access to be more efficient.


## What is the difference between actors classes and structs?

- Swift provides `four concrete nominal types for defining custom objects`: `actors`, `classes`, `structs`, and `enums`.

- `Tip`: Ultimately, which you use depends on the exact context you’re working in, and you will need them all at some point.

- Actors:

1. Are `reference types`, so are good for `shared mutable state`.

2. Can have properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts.

3. Do not support inheritance.

4. Automatically conform to the `Actor` protocol.

5. Automatically conform to the `AnyObject` protocol, and can therefore conform to `Identifiable` without adding an explicit `id` property.

6. Can have a deinitializer.

7. Cannot have their public properties and methods directly accessed externally, we must use `await`.

8. Can `execute only one method at a time`, regardless of how they are accessed.


- Classes:

1. Are reference types, so are good for shared mutable state.

2. Can have properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts.

3. Support inheritance.

4. Cannot conform to the `Actor` protocol.

5. Automatically conform to the `AnyObject` protocol, and can therefore conform to `Identifiable` without adding an explicit `id` property.

6. Can have a deinitializer.

7. Can have their public properties and methods directly accessed externally.

8. Can potentially be executing severals methods at a time.


- Structs:

1. Are value types, so are copied rather than shared.

2. Can have properties, methods, initializers, and subscripts.

3. Do not support inheritance.

4. Cannot conform to the `Actor` protocol.

5. Cannot conform to the `AnyObject` protocol; if you want to add `Identifiable` conformance you must add an `id` property yourself.

6. Cannot have a deinitializer.

7. Can have their public properties and methods directly accessed externally.

8. Can potentially be executing severals methods at a time.

- You might think the advantages of actors are such that they should be used everywhere classes are currently used, but `that is a bad idea`.

- Not only do you `lose the ability for inheritance`, but you’ll also cause a huge amount of pain for yourself because `every single external property access needs to use await`.

- However, there are certainly places where actors are a natural fit.

- If you were previously creating serial queues to handle specific workflows, they can be replaced almost entirely with `actors` – while also benefiting from increased safety and performance.

- So, `if you have some work that absolutely must work one at a time`, `such as accessing a database`, then `try converting it into something like a database actor`.

- There is `one area in particular where using actors rather than classes is going to cause problems`:

- `Do not use actors for your SwiftUI data models`.

- You should use a `class` that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol instead.

- If needed, you can optionally also mark that `class` with `@MainActor` to ensure it `does any UI work safely`, but keep in mind that using `@StateObject` or `@ObservedObject` automatically `makes a view’s code run on the main actor`.

- If you desperately need to be able to `carve off some async work safely`, you can `create a sibling actor` – a `separate actor that does not use @MainActor`, but `does not directly update the UI`.


## Do not use an actor for your SwiftUI data models

- Swift’s `actors allow us to share data in multiple parts of our app without causing problems with concurrency`, because `they automatically ensure two pieces of code cannot simultaneously access the actor’s protected data`.

- Actors are an important addition to our toolset, and `help us guarantee safe access to data in concurrent environments`.

- `Actors are a really bad choice for any data models you use with SwiftUI` – anything that conforms to the `ObservableObject` protocol.

- SwiftUI `updates its user interface on the main actor`, which means when we make a `class` conform to `ObservableObject` we’re agreeing that all our work will happen on the `main actor`. 

- As an example, any time we modify an `@Published` property `that must happen on the main actor`, otherwise we’ll be asking for changes to be made somewhere that isn’t allowed.

- Now think about what would happen if you tried to use a `custom actor` for your data. 

- Not only would any data writes need to happen on that `actor` rather than the `main actor` (thus `forcing the UI to update away from the main actor`), but `any data reads would need to happen there too` – every time you tried to bind a string to a TextField, for example, you’d be asking Swift to simultaneously use the `main actor` and your `custom actor`, which doesn’t make sense.

- The correct solution here is to use a class that conforms to `ObservableObject`, then annotate it with `@MainActor` to `ensure it does any UI work safely`.

- If you still find that `you need to be able to carve off some async work safely`, you can create a `sibling actor` – `a separate actor that does not use @MainActor`, but `does not directly update the UI`.
